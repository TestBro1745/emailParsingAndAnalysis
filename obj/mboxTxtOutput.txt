++RECIPIENT_FIRNAME++ for the past two weeks we've seen just how low the Democrats will sink in order to obstruct our agenda and everything we've accomplished since 2016.
Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer shut down YOUR government by choosing illegal immigrants over hard-working American patriots like YOU. NO MORE!
The only reason Democrats shut down the government is because they know they can't win in 2020. They don't care about your safety, they only care about Presidential Harassment!
We showed them in 2016, now let's show them again that the silent majority is back and will NEVER be forgotten again.
We're going to remind each and every Democrat that the American people voted for border security, the rule of law and to BUILD THE WALL!

++HYPERLINK++ 
I need you to add your name to publicly to stand with me in this fight. >>

I will not rest until the Democrats finally understand that Americans WILL ALWAYS COME FIRST!

 President Trump just finished his speech addressing our National Security crisis on the Southern Border and explaining why he will NOT cave to the Democrats when it comes to YOUR SAFETY.
 We sent him a list of all patriots who donated to our Official Secure the Border Fund and he noticed your name wasn't on the list, N.
 He figured this couldn't be right because he knows how much you care about BUILDING THE WALL.
 Since you've been such a strong supporter and one of our greatest advocates for THE WALL, we have decided to extend your deadline to get on the list to 11:59 PM TONIGHT.

That's why I want to do something so HUGE, even Democrats and the Fake News won't be able to ignore.

Democrats have become incredibly UNHINGED in the past couple of months.
They claim they want border security, and they claim they care about your safety, but they have done ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to prove that. They won't even meet at the White House to negotiate!
The Democrat way is very simple: complain, obstruct, do nothing to help America, and then ask for your vote 2 years later. NO MORE!

Friend,
Now that we are officially in 2018, President Trump has requested a list of all supporters who have renewed their 2018 Membership by MIDNIGHT TONIGHT.
These are the patriots who are laying the early foundation for an even stronger second year of our historic presidency. These are the patriots who refuse to let the media define our movement.
And this is your chance to put your name up top, Friend.

++HYPERLINK++ 
Please make a contribution of $1 to renew your 2018 Sustaining Membership before MIDNIGHT TONIGHT to show the President he has the FULL backing of the American people in the new year.

It's up to us to prove them WRONG. Let's show them that we are starting off the year stronger than we started his inauguration.
America is waking up to the fake news. We're waking up to the lies liberals have been feeding our country for decades. We are still fighting to take our country, and we will not rest.

Thanks to you, America is getting the biggest tax cut in history. This never could've happened without your support. OUR bill...
 Cuts taxes by $1.5 TRILLION

 Repeals the ObamaCare mandate

 Brings back American money parked overseas

 Increases the child tax credit for working families

 Makes American industry competitive with the world

 Overhauls our complicated, loophole-infested tax code
Now I want to close out our historic inaugural year STRONG, because this is not my presidency, it's yours. It belongs to the people who truly power our nation.
Please make a grassroots contribution to show our movement is only getting started: America is coming roaring back, bigger, stronger, and GREATER than EVER before!

I promised you I would only appoint justices in the mold of the late, great Justice Antonin Scalia.
Last night, I once again fulfilled that promise by appointing a strong constitutionalist, the Honorable Brett M. Kavanaugh, to the Supreme Court.
Judge Kavanaugh will protect our religious liberties, uphold the rule of law, and interpret the Constitution as it was originally understood by our Founders.
Senate liberals know that we have the opportunity to reshape the Supreme Court for an entire GENERATION, and they are ready to obstruct and unleash a smear campaign against our nominee.

Just like during Justice Gorsuch's confirmation hearings, we need to remind Democrats to stop playing politics and to put America FIRST.

++HYPERLINK++ 
Please sign our official petition telling the Liberal OBSTRUCTIONISTS to confirm Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. 
This is what we're up against:
++HYPERLINK++ 
(Washington Free Beacon, 6/27/18)

++HYPERLINK++ 

(Washington Times, 6/28/18)
We must stand strong against the dirty tactics coming our way. The fate of the Supreme Court -- and our Constitution -- hangs in the balance, and the Democrats will NOT give up easily.

++HYPERLINK++ 
Sign our official petition telling Liberal obstructionists to confirm Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court NOW. 
Thank you,

The liberal swamp will never learn. That's why I just VETOED the Pro-Crime, Pro-Drugs, and Pro-Open Borders Democrat inspired resolution.
Liberals in the Senate chose politics, I chose YOU.
59 Senators voted to put illegal immigrants and political games over YOUR safety. DISGRACEFUL!
But, when I asked American Patriots (the people that matter) over 93% said YES VETO & FINISH THE WALL. When the people talk, I always listen.

As your Commander-in-Chief, I will NEVER put politics over the safety of American Citizens, so help me God.
Even with this Veto, the attacks will keep coming from the 'Border Deniers' and their allies in the mainstream media. We have to do something HUGE to have the resources to fight back.
That's why I need you to contribute to the most important fund of my presidency - the OFFICIAL WALL DEFENSE FUND.

So please, take the Presidents Official State of the Union Survey before 11:59 PM TONIGHT to ensure your opinions about our GREAT nation will be included. >>

Never forget how powerful your voice is. It's only because of the millions of petitions we sent the Democrats that they finally opened back up the government after shutting it down to protect illegal immigrants.
You were the reason we won in 2016. You will be the reason why one of todays prototypes will become the wall that STOPS illegal immigration.

Subject:     RESPONSIBLE immigration reform

Friend,
For years, politicians have talked about 'compassionate' immigration reform, but every one of their proposals showed ZERO compassion for American workers, the victims of illegal immigration crime, and for the safety and security of our nation.
It's time for RESPONSIBLE immigration reform that actually puts the interests of American citizens first.

There's been a lot of talk recently from liberals in the Senate So before we move forward on ANYTHING, I want to have the full force of the American people united behind a plan that we want. I want to hear your immigration demands, Friend.
++HYPERLINK++ 
Please take my Responsible Immigration Survey by MIDNIGHT TONIGHT. 
Chuck and Nancy -- and EVERY obstructionist -- need to understand that it's not just me that wants these critical proposals turned into law
These are the demands of the American PEOPLE. Your elected officials need to know just how many voters will be furious if our demands are not met.

And I want to be able to give an exact number of how many people back each proposal. This is the Art of the Deal!

++HYPERLINK++ 
So please, take my Responsible Immigration Survey by MIDNIGHT TONIGHT. 
Thank you,

++HYPERLINK++

Now he's ready to do it again.
These rallies are also a great tool to register voters, help people find their polling places, and guarantee each and every American citizen who believes in our agenda gets to the polls.
The radical Left is fired-up. Now it's time for President Trump to fire-up America.

I will not hide from the truth -- this is a WITCH HUNT.
Nancy Pelosi is now using the Russia witch hunt as a political ploy to RAISE MONEY from her supporters who still can't accept that you voted to Make America Great Again!

Why are they launching a witch hunt?
Because they don't want to Make America Great Again for YOU.
They don't want a wall. They don't want to stop the endless flow of illegal immigrants. They don't want Americans' wages to rise. They don't want to stop nation-building abroad. They don't want to help hardworking Americans. They don't want a fair economy that works for ALL Americans.
But I will keep fighting for you. This is what you voted for -- and this is what you deserve after so many years of broken promises by lying politicians.

Two years ago today I humbly became your President and gave the country back to the American people:

 'January 20th, 2017 will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer...America will start winning again, winning like never before.'
Since my inauguration we have seen that no dream is too big for America, regardless of what the Mainstream Media or Liberal Obstructionists say.

Former President Barack H. Obama laughed and said it would take 'a magic wand' to reach 4% GDP. Together, we reached 4.2% GDP.
The Media mocked us saying OUR policies wouldn't bring back jobs. Unemployment is now near the lowest since 1969.
Democrats and the Fake News said OUR tax cuts would crash the economy. Now, we are seeing historic economic growth.
Together, we have proven that our country is at its best when it is in YOUR hands, N. There is nothing we can't accomplish.
The Democrats and media are desperate and will do anything to gain power in 2020. That's why I need you on my side in this fight, because this is YOUR COUNTRY, not theirs.

CONTRIBUTE $1  We have now entered a CRITICAL election year. The media is hoping to claim that 2018 will be a referendum on President Trump.
It's up to us to prove them WRONG. Let's show them that we are starting off the year stronger than we started his inauguration.
America is waking up to the fake news. We're waking up to the lies liberals have been feeding our country for decades. We are still fighting to take our country, and we will not rest.

CNN is at it again. Their latest phony poll claims that 64% of Americans=20=
have less confidence in President Trump than they did one year ago. Yet of=
 more than 1,000 people interviewed, just 24% were Republicans.

The media has proven again and again that their disdain for President Trump=

ident Trump=E2=80=99s many great accomplishments. Now we want to hear from=
 you: what do YOU think about President Trump=E2=80=99s leadership of our=
 country so far?

How would you rate President Trump's job so far?

OKAY

 of America lives.

We can=E2=80=99t rely on these liberal echo chambers to speak for us any=20=

Now we are asking all of you -- the forgotten and silenced voices of Americ=

I'm headed to El Paso, Texas, tomorrow for a huge rally at our Southern Border to show Democrats how much Americans demand THE WALL.
While Democrats refuse to acknowledge the crisis at our Southern Border, the safety of Americans is threatened every day....
Just a few days ago, an MS-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in New York City. We're removing these gang members by the thousands, but until we secure our border they're going to keep streaming back in.
Even with this knowledge, Democrats have chosen petty games over the safety of Americans.
During my State of the Union Address, I called for unity, asking Democrats to finally choose greatness over gridlock.

Now he's ready to do it again.
These rallies are also a great tool to register voters, help people find their polling places, and guarantee each and every American citizen who believes in our agenda gets to the polls.

Friend,
For years, politicians have talked about 'compassionate' immigration reform, but every one of their proposals showed ZERO compassion for American workers, the victims of illegal immigration crime, and for the safety and security of our nation.
It's time for RESPONSIBLE immigration reform that actually puts the interests of American citizens first.

There's been a lot of talk recently from liberals in the Senate So before we move forward on ANYTHING, I want to have the full force of the American people united behind a plan that we want. I want to hear your immigration demands, Friend.
++HYPERLINK++ 
Please take my Responsible Immigration Survey by MIDNIGHT TONIGHT. 
Chuck and Nancy -- and EVERY obstructionist -- need to understand that it's not just me that wants these critical proposals turned into law
These are the demands of the American PEOPLE. Your elected officials need to know just how many voters will be furious if our demands are not met.

And I want to be able to give an exact number of how many people back each proposal. This is the Art of the Deal!

++HYPERLINK++ 
So please, take my Responsible Immigration Survey by MIDNIGHT TONIGHT. 
Thank you,

++HYPERLINK++

Friend,
We never received your 2018 Listening to America Survey. There's no better time to complete it than during the Oscars -- while a bunch of Hollywood liberals prove to the country that they have NO IDEA what the real America thinks or believes.

++HYPERLINK++ 
Please take the 2018 Listening to America Survey now. 
The Oscars are NOTHING but a three-hour ad by Hollywood liberals blasting their hatred for hardworking patriots like you.
If they actually left their bubble, they'd learn about the real America where we believe in STRONG borders (yes, a WALL!), stopping radical Islamic terrorism, championing the right to life, defending ourselves and our families, and always, always, always putting America FIRST.

Friend,
Everyone in D.C. and the media have been shouting at each other, but they need to stop and listen to the only people that matter -- YOU.
Reporters don't get to make laws and politicians don't get to usher in sweeping change without FIRST consulting you.

It's time for Washington to stop bickering and LISTEN to America.

++HYPERLINK++ 
That's why I've commissioned a brand new Listening to America Survey for the 2018 year for you to take IMMEDIATELY. 
I've released this survey every year since 2016, and it's been a huge success. It's our best way to hear from the REAL America on the big issues of the day.
And every single time we learn the same thing -- that the mainstream media is TOTALLY out of touch with the hardworking Americans who truly run our nation.
Now I want to use this survey to ensure we're fighting for YOUR priorities as we move forward in 2018.

++HYPERLINK++ 
Please take the Listening to America Survey for the 2018 year. 
THANK YOU,

++HYPERLINK++

It's clear that deep in her heart, she simply doesn't care about the safety and well-being of American Citizens. Your security is at risk because of the crisis at our southern border -- a major entry point for criminals, gang members, and illegal drugs.
Since Nancy has become Speaker of the House she has done absolutely nothing but OBSTRUCT our progress. It's a TOTAL CON-JOB put on by Democratic leadership.

++HYPERLINK++ 
It's so unprecedented that I'm coming to you immediately to ask for your help and your $1. 
I'll be frank -- what is happening at our border is not remotely an emergency.
Our Democrats have told the president this time and time again.

But instead of working with me on behalf of the American People, President Trump has decided to throw a temper tantrum and override the will of the people to fund his expensive and ineffective wall.
I've had enough.
I won't allow this charade to continue, and I know I can count an ENORMOUS backlash from grassroots Democrats to fight back with me.
So, please, will you rush in $1 to send a message to Trump straight away?

This moment is so unprecedented -- and so important -- I'll personally triple match your gift.

++HYPERLINK++ 
Triple match your $1 >> 

++HYPERLINK++ 
Triple match your $35 >> 

++HYPERLINK++ 
Triple match your $50 >> 

++HYPERLINK++ 
Triple match your $100 >> 

++HYPERLINK++ 
Triple match your $250 >> 

++HYPERLINK++ 
Or triple match another amount >> 
Thank you,
Nancy

Democrats are willing to fight for ANYONE illegally crossing our border. But they too often refuse to fight for their own fellow American citizens who voted to Make America Great Again!
Too many on the Left push a message of anger, resistance, and violent rhetoric.

Our movement is about prosperity, security, and love for America.

Now let's show the media and the Democrats how much love our movement has by making our end-of-quarter fundraising report our best one in HISTORY. Can I count you to make a grassroots contribution?

Nancy Pelosi and Democrats have not negotiated in good faith to fund a wall at our Southern Border, proving that obstruction is far more important to them than YOUR SAFETY.
Last week, more than 95% of the Patriots I polled demanded a wall. That's because WALLS WORK! I was just in the great city of El Paso, Texas, where illegal traffic has dropped over 90% because of their beautiful wall.
I cannot allow America's safety and security to be put at risk any longer. We need the wall, and I must put AMERICA FIRST!
Nancy and Democrats have said they will consider filing a legal challenge to ensure the wall is never built, as they continue putting illegal immigrants before Americans. So, we need you to make a HUGE statement to them right now.

 Ever since President Trump emerged on the national stage, we've watched as coastal elites all over the media have tried to silence and attack anyone who supports him.

Social media platforms are now flagging conservatives who speak up on behalf of the President's America First agenda as 'offensive content.'
It's time for the Silent Majority to defend our voice in America.

We didn't see your name on the Vice President's official birthday card.
Vice President Pence has done an unbelievable job fighting by the President's side to Make America Great Again.
That's why we'd love to give him a birthday card this year signed by all of his top supporters.
We wanted to reach out to you one last time to see if you'd add your name and make his birthday one to remember.

Please sign the Vice President's official birthday card by 9:00 P.M. tonight.

Friend,
When I became your president one year ago today, I took an oath to protect, serve, and lead ALL Americans.
Democrats have since shown our country that they could never do the same.
They chose to use our U.S. military as a bargaining chip to fight for amnesty for non-citizen illegal immigrants. But a good many patriots and I REFUSED to accept their ransom.

Now American voters need to remind Democrats that we will NEVER forget their reckless decision.

++HYPERLINK++ 
Tell Senate Democrats that YOU -- the American voter -- will ALWAYS remember the day that Democrats put illegal immigrants before American citizens. >> 
Thank you -- and stand strong!

Ever since our incredible movement began, the Democrats have been against us.
And over the past few weeks, they have taken their obstruction and radicalism to a whole new UN-AMERICAN level.
First, they REFUSED to put the safety of Americans at our Southern Border above their own political interests, and then they disinvited me from speaking at the PEOPLE'S State of the Union on the original date.
As your Commander-In-Chief, I will always put the safety of America First, and whether they like it or not, I'm delivering YOUR State of the Union Address on February 5th.
Last year, we had over 3O,OOO American Patriots contribute to have their name proudly displayed LIVE during my State of the Union Address, and this year I expect DOUBLE.

On the eve of our incredible election in 2016, President Trump held five rallies in a single day and was out until 3 in the morning to get out the vote!
Now he's ready to do it again.
These rallies are also a great tool to register voters, help people find their polling places, and guarantee each and every American citizen who believes in our agenda gets to the polls.
The radical Left is fired-up. Now it's time for President Trump to fire-up America.

(Washington Examiner, 2/21/18)
Every 'sanctuary city' is COMPLICIT in this travesty. These are who the Democrats SHUT DOWN the American government over.
You -- and millions of Americans like you -- voted to finally put the American citizens FIRST. But we can't do that until we end sanctuary cities that are an ASSAULT on the rule of law.

Where is the sanctuary for the American citizens who have been the victims of criminal acts by illegal immigrants?
Where is the justice in OUR federal tax dollars going to fund cities and states that DEFY FEDERAL LAW and put our families and homes at risk?
These are not 'sanctuaries.' These are lawless havens for criminals that must end NOW.

It's been my great honor to fight for you. But because our mission has been about you, I want to hear your thoughts and opinions.

++HYPERLINK++ 
Please take the First 500 Days Approval Survey. 
Because of your support,++RECIPIENT_FIRNAME++ we have.
  - Put ISIS on the run, and sent a message to our adversaries that terrorism and threats against our national security will no longer be tolerated 

  - Initiated historic talks with North Korea to denuclearize the Korean peninsula and achieve peace and global stability 

  - Enacted sweeping tax reform, putting hard earned money back in the pockets of Americans 

  - Brought the unemployment numbers to a record low, tying the lowest rate since 1969 Reduced harmful regulations on American industry that had been crippling the U.S. Economy since the Obama administration 

  - Strengthened our borders like never before: criminals are now being stopped at the border, harmful drugs are being seized, and America is getting safer....and so much more.
No longer is the government working against the American People. Now, with your help, I am putting its power back into your hands.
But what matters most is that YOU approve of the work we've done to Make America Great Again!

Friend,
++HYPERLINK++ 

Here are some key highlights just from evening newscasts:
  - 90% of coverage about the President was negative
  - 5,266 negative comments were aired, as opposed to just 617 positive comments
  - The Russia witch-hunt accounted for more than ONE-FIFTH of the President's coverage
Over the course of 2017, the supposedly 'unbiased media' had a LOT to say about President Trump's first year in office
Now it's time for the media to hear from YOU.

 FLASH POLL: DO YOU BELIEVE THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA WAS INTENTIONALLY NEGATIVE AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP? >>
++HYPERLINK++ 
YES  
++HYPERLINK++ 
NO  The media did nothing but DROOL over Obama's every move - and now they just can't handle the fact that President Trump won in a landslide despite being in the tank for Hillary.

But we don't want the media to take our word for it. We want them to hear it directly from you, the American people.

++HYPERLINK++ 
Take the Negative Media Poll and let the mainstream media know just how unprofessional and irrelevant they actually are. 
 MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,
 Team TRUMP

JUST IN: the Vice President declared that it's time for Robert Mueller to wrap up the 'Russia' investigation.
After a year of finding NO evidence, this witch hunt serves no purpose but to distract from our country's historic accomplishments.
At this critical moment, we're asking our strongest supporters: 

 Do you think it's time for Robert Mueller to conclude this witch hunt? 
++HYPERLINK++ 
YES 

++HYPERLINK++ 
NO 
This is the most important survey we've sent you all year.
The investigation can't go on forever. The President needs to know when you think it's time for Mueller to conclude it.
Nancy Pelosi has already started using this government-sponsored witch hunt as a political weapon to raise money to win the midterm elections.
Has the time finally come to end this political game? You tell us.

++HYPERLINK++ 
Please respond by 9:00 PM SHARP TONIGHT to let the President know if you think it's time for Robert Mueller to conclude the 'Russia' investigation. 
Thank you,
Team TRUMP

I'm headed to El Paso, Texas, today for a huge rally at our Southern Border to show Democrats how much Americans demand THE WALL.
While Democrats refuse to acknowledge the crisis at our Southern Border, the safety of Americans is threatened every day....
Just last week, an MS-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in New York City. We're removing these gang members by the thousands, but until we secure our border they're going to keep streaming back in.
Even with this knowledge, Democrats have chosen petty games over the safety of Americans.
During my State of the Union Address, I called for unity, asking Democrats to finally choose greatness over gridlock.
With Congress' deadline to fund the wall on February 15th, I need you to help put pressure on the Democrats and become an Official Build the Wall Member.

I don't care how many lying books they write.

I will never stop fighting for you. I will never let them silence you. Nothing will distract us from our agenda. Nothing can yank us down into the gutters with the fake news tabloids disguised as the 'mainstream media.'
But I need you enlisted in our fight too. Will you go down in the books and renew your Sustaining Membership for the 2018 year?

And this is your chance to put your name up top, Friend.

We have now entered a CRITICAL election year. The media is hoping to claim that 2018 will be a referendum on President Trump.
It's up to us to prove them WRONG. Let's show them that we are starting off the year stronger than we started his inauguration.
America is waking up to the fake news. We're waking up to the lies liberals have been feeding our country for decades. We are still fighting to take our country, and we will not rest.

The media is cheering for our agenda to fail.
But they need to understand that if our agenda fails, our country does too.
That's why I'm fighting at all hours of the day to give you the agenda you voted for.
That means STRONG BORDERS (including the wall), reforming immigration, bringing back jobs, renegotiating trade deals, and protecting your rights.
Not only did we confirm Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, but we ALSO confirmed ANOTHER 15 GREAT JUDGES who will serve our country FOR LIFE!

Of course the media won't tell you that, because they can't stand when we win.

Friend,

YOU are the reason our government is back open.
Ever since the Schumer Shutdown, we received 48 petitions per second from Americans like you, demanding Democrats stop holding our military hostage to give amnesty to illegal immigrants.
Democrats in red states we won big league saw how ANGRY you were with their disgusting tactics, and couldn't go on any longer. This is how we win -- by rallying together and fighting!

But during this shutdown, Pelosi raised hundreds of thousands of dollars from her radical base that wants unchecked illegal immigration.
We can't let them get away with it. We will never forget the names of EVERY single liberal obstructionist responsible for this disgusting shut down, and we will work to FIRE them come November.

I promised you that the forgotten men and women of this great country would be forgotten no more and that I would NEVER stop fighting for you, N.

We have now entered a CRITICAL election year. The media is hoping to claim that 2018 will be a referendum on President Trump.
It's up to us to prove them WRONG. Let's show them that we are starting off the year stronger than we started his inauguration.
America is waking up to the fake news. We're waking up to the lies liberals have been feeding our country for decades. We are still fighting to take our country, and we will not rest.

Over the past couple of weeks, Democratic presidential candidates have been unveiling their 2020 strategy and it's TERRIFYING. Just look at their main talking points:
  - 90% proposed tax rate
  - Wide-open borders
  - Full-term abortion
  - Ripping away 2nd Amendment rights
  - Government-run healthcare
  - Full-blown socialismThis isn't a joke, this is actually what Democratic presidential candidates are running on in 2020 and we need to know what you think about this, N.

Since the day I rode down the escalator with Melania to announce my candidacy for President, I have told the consultants to GET LOST and instead have crafted my message straight from YOU -- the people.
Despite HATEFUL criticism from the media, our strategy has been working time and time again.
Our economy is booming. American unemployment is at its lowest since 1969. Coal, steel, and manufacturing jobs are coming back. Trade deals are being re-negotiated to the benefit of the American people. And we are fighting liberals to close our wide-open border.
But I'm not finished. We still have a lot left to do until we can say that we truly made America great again.
Now I need your help with our Voter Target Survey today to make sure that we turn out the our voters with the right message.

 In two years, there's been NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION.
 But the DNC is now SUING my presidential campaign to keep the Russia witch hunt going and their bankrupt party alive.
 I will NEVER surrender this fight, because this isn't just about some political race. This is about saving America from an elitist swamp that thinks it can lie, cheat, and attack its way into power.
 We are fighting for something more important than politics. We are fighting for you.
But it could all be lost if we lose our members who are the greatest defenders of our movement. I hope you'll step up as a 2018 Sustaining Member. Your membership has NEVER been more critical.

The Justice Department is SUING the state of California for violating the Constitution by passing laws that shield illegal immigrants.

President Trump is now facing EXTREME backlash from Democrats and the fake news.

Add your name to show you support the Department of Justices lawsuit against sanctuary state California.

Democrats remain defiant in their insubordination of federal law -- and they have the entire fake news media machine parroting their talking points.

The mayor of Oakland, California went so far as to publically tip off illegal immigrants when ICE was about to begin its arrests of known criminals.

Americans across the country now can see that Democrats have officially become the party of obstruction, lawlessness, government shutdowns, and of putting illegal immigrants before American citizens.

The President is calling on you to stand by him in the face of such flagrant lawlessness.

Add your name to show you support the Department of Justices lawsuit against sanctuary state California.

Thank you,

Team TRUMP

Even before President Trump finished his speech on the White House lawn, Senate Democrats had introduced a bill to stop him from declaring a National Emergency at our border. This level of obstruction is disgraceful and far worse than any President has ever faced.
The President had no choice but to declare a National Emergency at our southern border, a major entry point by which criminals, gang members, and drugs that kill American citizens come into our country.

 THIS IS A NATIONAL EMERGENCY. WE MUST PUT AMERICA FIRST
Democrats will do everything they can to make sure THE WALL is never built, so it's up to YOU to send them a message to FINISH THE WALL.
We are still short of our ambitious goal of raising $2,OOO,OOO, so the President asked us to reach out to you personally, N.

Nancy Pelosi and Democrats have not negotiated in good faith to fund a wall at our Southern Border, proving that obstruction is far more important to them than YOUR SAFETY.
Last week, more than 95% of the Patriots I polled demanded a wall. That's because WALLS WORK! I was just in the great city of El Paso, Texas, where illegal traffic has dropped over 90% because of their beautiful wall.
I cannot allow America's safety and security to be put at risk any longer. We need the wall, and I must put AMERICA FIRST!
Nancy and Democrats have said they will consider filing a legal challenge to ensure the wall is never built, as they continue putting illegal immigrants before Americans. So, we need you to make a HUGE statement to them right now.
I'm setting a goal of raising $2,OOO,OOO. I know a goal this big is unprecedented, but we need the American people to make a powerful statement to these Democrats to FINISH THE WALL.

Two years ago today I humbly became your President and gave the country back to the American people:

 'January 20th, 2017 will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer...America will start winning again, winning like never before.'
Since my inauguration we have seen that no dream is too big for America, regardless of what the Mainstream Media or Liberal Obstructionists say.

Former President Barack H. Obama laughed and said it would take 'a magic wand' to reach 4% GDP. Together, we reached 4.2% GDP.
The Media mocked us saying OUR policies wouldn't bring back jobs. Unemployment is now near the lowest since 1969.
Democrats and the Fake News said OUR tax cuts would crash the economy. Now, we are seeing historic economic growth.
Together, we have proven that our country is at its best when it is in YOUR hands, N. There is nothing we can't accomplish.
The Democrats and media are desperate and will do anything to gain power in 2020. That's why I need you on my side in this fight, because this is YOUR COUNTRY, not theirs.

'Democratic candidates in the vast majority of competitive House races have more money to spend than their GOP counterparts in the final weeks of the campaign for control of Congress, bolstered by an energized base that's unleashed a flood of donations.'
  There's NO WAY Democrats are more energized than you.
...Especially not after what they did to Justice Kavanaugh's family, their open borders insanity, their terrible job-killing policies, their hatred for the rule of law, and their failure to look after hardworking Americans FIRST.

We've already seen how far liberals have gone to try and sabotage our administration.
We can only imagine what they'd do with legitimate power in our government.
I need you to defend our agenda, our country, and our Presidency.

President Trump called for an end to the ridiculous partisan WITCH HUNT during his State of the Union Address:

 'An economic miracle is taking place in the United States -- and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics or ridiculous partisan investigations. If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation.'
The Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Richard Burr, just concluded that after 2 years of investigation, if they were to write a report based upon the facts that they have, then they wouldn't have anything that would suggest there was collusion by the Trump campaign.

 THIS IS AN ORCHESTRATED DEMOCRATIC HIT JOB TO HARASS PRESIDENT TRUMP

  - Spread Comey's lies 
  - Sued the Trump campaign with zero evidence
Here's what President Trump did:

  - Announced big talks with foreign leaders
  - Reported the best jobs numbers in 45 years 
  - Blocked 1,000 illegal immigrants from entering the U.S.

I promised you I would only appoint justices in the mold of the late, great Justice Antonin Scalia.
Today, I am once again fulfilling that promise by appointing a strong constitutionalist, the Honorable Brett M. Kavanaugh, to the Supreme Court.
Judge Kavanaugh will protect our religious liberties, uphold the rule of law, and interpret the Constitution as it was originally understood by our Founders.
Senate liberals know that we have the opportunity to reshape the Supreme Court for an entire GENERATION, and they are ready to obstruct and unleash a smear campaign against our nominee.

Just like during Justice Gorsuch's confirmation hearings, we need to remind Democrats to stop playing politics and to put America FIRST.

++HYPERLINK++ 
Please sign our official petition telling the Liberal OBSTRUCTIONISTS to confirm Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. 
This is what we're up against:
++HYPERLINK++ 
(Washington Free Beacon, 6/27/18)

++HYPERLINK++ 

(Washington Times, 6/28/18)
We must stand strong against the dirty tactics coming our way. The fate of the Supreme Court -- and our Constitution -- hangs in the balance, and the Democrats will NOT give up easily.

++HYPERLINK++ 
Sign our official petition telling Liberal obstructionists to confirm Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court NOW. 
Thank you,

The media is cheering for our agenda to fail.
But they need to understand that if our agenda fails, our country does too.
That's why I'm fighting at all hours of the day to give you the agenda you voted for.
That means STRONG BORDERS (including the wall), reforming immigration, bringing back jobs, renegotiating trade deals, and protecting your rights.
Not only did we confirm Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, but we ALSO confirmed ANOTHER 15 GREAT JUDGES who will serve our country FOR LIFE!

Of course the media won't tell you that, because they can't stand when we win.

 [SORRY THIS DOCUMENT IS BLANK]
After more than 2 years of an endless Witch Hunt, there is still NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION.
This Witch Hunt has been orchestrated by loser Democrats and their friends in the Fake News Media.
They claim they plan to release the report 'soon' but they've been saying that for OVER 2 YEARS.
More than half of the country thinks this is a complete Witch Hunt and needs to end. Now we need to know what you think, N.

At this critical moment, we're asking our strongest supporters:
Do you think it's time for this WITCH HUNT to conclude once and for all? 
++HYPERLINK++ 
YES  
++HYPERLINK++ 
NO 
This is the most important survey we've sent you this year.
President Trump needs to know if you think it's time to conclude this never-ending investigation.

++HYPERLINK++ 
Please respond by 10:00 PM TONIGHT to let the President know if you think it's time to end the WITCH HUNT NOW. 
Thank you,
Team Trump 2020

It's been over 500 days since I took the Oath of Office and promised you we would Make America Great Again!
It's been my great honor to fight for you. But because our mission has been about you, I want to hear your thoughts and opinions.

++HYPERLINK++ 
Please take the First 500 Days Approval Survey. 
Because of your support,++RECIPIENT_FIRNAME++ we have.
  - Put ISIS on the run, and sent a message to our adversaries that terrorism and threats against our national security will no longer be tolerated 

  - Initiated historic talks with North Korea to denuclearize the Korean peninsula and achieve peace and global stability 

  - Enacted sweeping tax reform, putting hard earned money back in the pockets of Americans 

  - Brought the unemployment numbers to a record low, tying the lowest rate since 1969 Reduced harmful regulations on American industry that had been crippling the U.S. Economy since the Obama administration 

  - Strengthened our borders like never before: criminals are now being stopped at the border, harmful drugs are being seized, and America is getting safer....and so much more.
No longer is the government working against the American People. Now, with your help, I am putting its power back into your hands.
But what matters most is that YOU approve of the work we've done to Make America Great Again!

++HYPERLINK++ 
So please, make it your priority to take my First 500 Days Approval Survey today to let me know what you think of the job we've done so far.

Now American voters need to remind Democrats that we will NEVER forget their reckless decision.

Friend,
Tonight's speech is not about me.
It's about you.
Which is why I want the names of every supporter who makes a special contribution today broadcast during my speech.

Please make a special State of the Union contribution to have your name broadcast during my speech on the Official Donald J. Trump for President livestream.
++HYPERLINK++ 
CONTRIBUTE $1  Every single day, you are LECTURED by the media as they tell you what you believe and how you feel about America.
But tonight, the media gets to hear from the AMERICAN PEOPLE.
They will learn about an America where we believe securing our borders is common sense, where our police officers are respected, where life is protected and faith is honored, where we are optimistic about our economy, and where we once again believe in the promise of America.
And they will get to see just how many Americans are dedicated to our movement.

No matter the amount you give, I will always appreciate the sacrifices you've made to keep our movement alive and strong. THANK YOU!

++HYPERLINK++

Judge Kavanaugh's name has been cleared for the SEVENTH TIME.

It's painful to think of what the Kavanaugh family has been through these past two weeks at the hands of some truly vicious and despicable senators in the Democrat Party.
Will the Democrats apologize to Mrs. Kavanaugh for the irreparable damage they've done to her entire family on live TV? Of course not.
Instead, Kirsten Gillibrand, Chuck Schumer, Elizabeth Warren, Tim Kaine, and the other most radical Democrat Senators will soon take the Senate floor to get even nastier.

We MUST stand strong. The presumption of innocence in America is at stake.

And this is your chance to put your name up top, Friend.

2018 is our chance to elect TRUMP ALLIES to the House and Senate who will give you the agenda you voted for. No more obstruction! We want what we voted for!

But it cannot happen unless we put up GREAT candidates who stand by our values and prove to America that they have the fire to fight to Make America Great Again!

So I need you to tell me what qualities YOU want to see in 2018 candidates by taking my GREAT Candidates Survey right now.

So many political geniuses out there would call up some overpaid consultant in D.C. to figure out what the people want.

I have a better idea. To find out what the people want, lets ASK THE PEOPLE. Doesnt that make sense?

Thats why its so important that I hear what you think about the kinds of allies you want to see elected in the CRITICAL 2018 midterm elections.

So please take my GREAT Candidates Survey immediately.

Thank you,

Friend,
When I became your president one year ago today, I took an oath to protect, serve, and lead ALL Americans.
Democrats have since shown our country that they could never do the same.
They chose to use our U.S. military as a bargaining chip to fight for amnesty for non-citizen illegal immigrants. But a good many patriots and I REFUSED to accept their ransom.

Now American voters need to remind Democrats that we will NEVER forget their reckless decision.

++HYPERLINK++ 
Tell Senate Democrats that YOU -- the American voter -- will ALWAYS remember the day that Democrats put illegal immigrants before American citizens. >> 
Thank you -- and stand strong!

Friend,
The most shocking thing isn't what was done to stop President Trump from winning the election...
...It's that despite everything they did, WE STILL WON.
But the real hero in that epic chapter of American history isn't my father it's you.
The media, the deep state, and special interests could never match your determination to fight for our country.

Now those forces are still out to get us. We need to keep fighting. Will you go down in the books and renew your Sustaining Membership for the 2018 year?

I'll be honest -- when I hear the vicious attacks hurled against my father, it's hard not to take them personally.
But then I remember that he chose to walk away from his old life to enlist in this fight. I remember that he's given a voice to 63 million forgotten Americans.
He knew what he was getting into. We all did. We knew that draining the swamp would force us to see the ugliest monsters lurking at the bottom.
They launch witch hunts against innocent men. They attack Sarah Huckabee Sanders. They've even barricaded our Homeland Security Director's house because she's trying to end illegal immigration.

That's why I felt compelled to write to you today, and tell you that I'm making a contribution.

++RECIPIENT_FIRNAME++

  Since the shutdown began, we have sent MILLIONS of your Build The Wall petition signatures to Chuck & Nancy and showed them every poll proving Americans not only want the wall, they DEMAND THE WALL.

  Sadly, they act like you dont even EXIST, N. They forgot about the Hard-Working American a long time ago, and only listen to Liberal Mega-Donors and Hollywood Elites.

  Thats why President Trump came up with a brilliant idea to make sure Chuck and Nancy have no choice but to listen to you, N.

For every $20.20 dollars raised by MIDNIGHT TONIGHT, we will send a BEAUTIFUL BRICK directly to the offices of Chuck Schumer or Nancy Pelosi.

  Each brick will be etched with facts about border security to remind Democrats why WE NEED THE WALL.

  Together, we can build a BIG BEAUTIFUL WALL around their offices to protect us from their radical left-wing agenda.
Please make a contribution of at least $20.20 by MIDNIGHT TONIGHT and we will send your brick directly to one of their offices. >>

Friend,
I didn't win the election... YOU did.
You took on the media and the establishment. They didn't want us to win. But you REFUSED to have it any other way. You were so sick of seeing politicians lie, cheat, and surrender. Enough was enough!
But those forces are still alive. They're angry with us and they won't go down without a fight.
I want you on the front-lines of that fight. I want your leadership in our movement. I want to show our opponents that we still have the same strength that the world witnessed on November 8, 2016.

Democrats have become incredibly UNHINGED in the past couple of months.
They claim they want border security, and they claim they care about your safety, but they have done ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to prove that. They won't even meet at the White House to negotiate!
The Democrat way is very simple: complain, obstruct, do nothing to help America, and then ask for your vote 2 years later. NO MORE!

But they failed for one simple reason YOU.

But now we need to keep fighting. If our members who built and sustained this movement start walking away, the swamp will win -- GUARANTEED.

Subject: re: Donald Trump just announced:
I don't want it to end like this.
I just heard that Nate Silver downgraded Democrats' chances of taking the House.
And now, I'm learning Donald Trump has personally dumped $2,OOO,OOO to save his Republicans.
So I'm coming straight to you. Because I refuse to lose this election to Donald Trump.
I need a heroic surge of grassroots support before midnight to fight back. You're my only hope at turning this around.
Can I count on you to rush in $1 before midnight?

It's so important, I'm personally triple-matching all gifts.

Please sign the petition by 11:59 PM tonight and demand the Senate to build the wall.
Never forget how powerful your voice is. It's only because of the millions of petitions we sent the Democrats that they finally opened back up the government after shutting it down to protect illegal immigrants.
You were the reason we won in 2016. You will be the reason why one of today's prototypes will become the wall that STOPS illegal immigration.

If we lose our borders, we lose our country.

The GREATEST State of the Union Address ever.   |
++RECIPIENT_FIRNAME++

Even before the State of the Union Address, Cryin Chuck and Democrats criticized President Trumps speech.

During his historic State of the Union Address he had a very clear message for Democrats like Cryin Chuck, who only obstruct:
Victory is not winning for our party, victory is winning for our country.
Its called AMERICA FIRST!

Here are some of the highlights from last nights historic State of the Union Address:

President Trump shared critical details about the CRISIS at our Southern Border, and finally exposed Democrats for their lies and obstruction.

He described our BOOMING ECONOMY and laid out a clear vision of our plan for continued American Greatness.

And he expressed a message of unity that ALL AMERICANS should be proud of.We know Democrats will criticize the speech. We know the Mainstream Media will criticize the speech. And we know the Coastal Elites will criticize the speech.

But the President doesnt care what they think. He only cares what you think, N.

President Trump will NOT be attending the White House Correspondents' Dinner on April 28... because he'd rather be with you.

While the fake news media are toasting to themselves in the swamp, the President will be holding a campaign rally in the great state of Michigan with his fellow deplorables.
He's inviting ONE PERSON and a friend of your choice as VIP guests to meet him and get your picture taken with the President.

 In two years, there's been NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION.
 But the DNC is now SUING my presidential campaign to keep the Russia witch hunt going and their bankrupt party alive.
 I will NEVER surrender this fight, because this isn't just about some political race. This is about saving America from an elitist swamp that thinks it can lie, cheat, and attack its way into power.
 We are fighting for something more important than politics. We are fighting for you.
But it could all be lost if we lose our members who are the greatest defenders of our movement. I hope you'll step up as a 2018 Sustaining Member. Your membership has NEVER been more critical.

Since the day I announced my Presidential run, the mainstream media has told the American people that the wall would never be built.
In 2016, Barack Obama, mocked the idea of building the wall and said, 'Good luck with that.'
And now Nancy Pelosi and her liberal con-artists are doing everything they can to obstruct the completion of the wall.
Well I have some BREAKING NEWS for all of them:

 THE WALL IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION RIGHT NOW AND IT IS BEAUTIFUL.

We're so close to reaching our ambitious goal of raising $2,000,000 to make a statement to Democrats to FINISH THE WALL. That's why I'm calling on you,++RECIPIENT_FIRNAME++to put us over the top. This is your moment to make a statement, it's in your hands now.

Since the #SchumerShutdown, Nancy Pelosi has retreated to a Hawaiian resort for the holidays and Maxine Waters is vacationing in the Bahamas.
The Democrats have made it crystal clear they have no intention of listening to the American people, and would rather put politics above YOUR safety just to obstruct President Trump's agenda.
That's why we need to do something drastic to make them listen.
In 2016 you showed them that the silent majority is back, now we need you to show them again.

Over the past week, 1,241,340 American patriots, like you, have signed petitions DEMANDING Democrats put America first and BUILD THE WALL.
We FLOODED their offices with your petitions, but Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi continue to do the only thing they know...OBSTRUCT!

Chuck and Nancy are SOLELY responsible for this shutdown because using the safety and security of American citizens as a bargaining tool to play political games is just plain WRONG.
Democrats have attacked us repeatedly over the years, but one thing has always kept me motivated to fight back and that's you, N.
This is a critical moment for the future and safety of our families, our loved ones and the United States of America.
That's why I am launching the most important membership program ever - the OFFICIAL BUILD THE WALL MEMBERSHIP. 
++HYPERLINK++

I was one of the conservatives who believed President Trump could win the White House. The energy in our country in October 2016 was like nothing I had ever witnessed. I knew the polls were missing something.
I want you to know that I'm not one to be swayed by doomsday polls put out by the media. But I must admit that I'm concerned that our House Majority could be in jeopardy.
Races are too close for comfort. The Left is fired up. With our final end-of-month deadline coming up, this is our moment to fight or lose.

Please make a contribution to help the President invest in the most important races that will decide the fate of the people's House -- and ultimately even the White House.

As Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi would be third in line for the presidency.
All work that has been done to secure funding for the wall, provide resources for border security, slash Obama's regulations, grow our economy, cut taxes, and protect miners, farmers, and all workers would be lost.
Instead, Democrats would use the people's House as a weapon to attack President Trump.

Friend,
When I became your president one year ago today, I took an oath to protect, serve, and lead ALL Americans.
Democrats have since shown our country that they could never do the same.
They chose to use our U.S. military as a bargaining chip to fight for amnesty for non-citizen illegal immigrants. But a good many patriots and I REFUSED to accept their ransom.

Now American voters need to remind Democrats that we will NEVER forget their reckless decision.

++HYPERLINK++ 
Tell Senate Democrats that YOU -- the American voter -- will ALWAYS remember the day that Democrats put illegal immigrants before American citizens. >> 
Thank you -- and stand strong!

Friend,
I didn't win the election... YOU did.
You took on the media and the establishment. They didn't want us to win. But you REFUSED to have it any other way. You were so sick of seeing politicians lie, cheat, and surrender. Enough was enough!
But those forces are still alive. They're angry with us and they won't go down without a fight.
I want you on the front-lines of that fight. I want your leadership in our movement. I want to show our opponents that we still have the same strength that the world witnessed on November 8, 2016.

Friend,
You were there when our movement began. You were there when they said we were destined to lose. You were there when the Washington swamp tried to destroy our presidency.
Friend, now I hope you will be there for my RE-ELECTION campaign in 2020 as we KEEP FIGHTING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Our big announcement comes on the day of a CRITICAL reporting deadline. Will you step up with a contribution of ANY amount to show you're ready to fight for another BIG win in 2020? 
++HYPERLINK++ 
CONTRIBUTE $1  You've seen how BRUTAL the fake news has been. You've seen how rabid the Democrats have become. We couldn't wait until 2019 to start fighting for re-election. We had to start NOW!
I don't care how many more witch hunts they launch...
I don't care how many more lies they spread about me and my family...
I don't care how many more cowards write fake books to try and distract the people...

Because there is NOTHING they can do to stop us from our mission to SAVE America.
So now that it's official, let's blow our first goal out of the park. Let's show the media we're fighting harder than EVER before to Make America Great Again!

++HYPERLINK++ 
Please make a contribution of just $1 before the first reporting deadline since our re-election announcement. 
Thank you,

When President Trump accepted the Republican nomination in 2016 he promised he would always speak for YOU, the forgotten American.
These are the forgotten men and women of our country. And they are forgotten, but they're not going to be forgotten long. These are people who work hard but no longer have a voice. I am your voice.
Tuesday night, President Trump stood firm in front of the entire nation and made good on that promise once again.

He clearly laid out the issues at our Southern Border, pointed out that Democrats have wanted a wall in the past, and DEMANDED Democrats quit playing games and protect American citizens.

We were so thankful to him for speaking out for all Americans. As one of our top supporters, we wanted to give you a special opportunity to say thank you.

We are going to send EVERY THANK YOU MESSAGE that is submitted within the NEXT 3 HOURS to President Trump.

Friend,
You might have heard Chuck Schumer say that the Wall is 'off the table.'

NO, IT'S NOT, CHUCK!
I have absolutely no problem walking away from any deal that does not fund our wall AND fails to stop the floodgates of illegal immigration.
If we don't truly secure our borders, you can say goodbye to our country.
Chuck needs to understand that this isn't just my demand. These are the non-negotiable demands of the American people! Tell Chuck NOW!

Because of President Trump's latest achievements, it's time to release a new approval poll.
Three American hostages were returned to the United States, peace is on the horizon, the 5 most wanted ISIS leaders have been captured, unemployment is down to 3.9%, and the Iran Deal was slashed.

But before we release our new approval poll to the major news outlets, we want YOU to have the chance to participate. 

 How would you rate the job President Trump is doing for America?

Without you, I would not be writing to you today.

  Hillary Clinton would have become president. She would have nominated two Supreme Court justices. Hundreds of caravans would have been welcomed across our border. ISIS would still be a threat. And our economy would have suffered four more years of Obamas failed policies.

  But I want to make one thing clear: it wasnt me who prevented that disaster

It was you.

  Now I need you to keep fighting for what we believe in by renewing your membership for 2019 earlier than ever before.

Since the shutdown began, we have sent MILLIONS of your Build The Wall petition signatures to Chuck & Nancy and showed them every poll proving Americans not only want the wall, they DEMAND THE WALL.
Sadly, they act like you don't even EXIST, N. They forgot about the Hard-Working American a long time ago, and only listen to Liberal Mega-Donors and Hollywood Elites.
That's why President Trump came up with a brilliant idea to make sure Chuck and Nancy have no choice but to listen to you, N.

For every $20.20 dollars raised by MIDNIGHT TONIGHT, we will send a BEAUTIFUL BRICK directly to the offices of Chuck Schumer or Nancy Pelosi.
Each brick will be etched with facts about border security to remind Democrats why WE NEED THE WALL.
Together, we can build a BIG BEAUTIFUL WALL around their offices to protect us from their radical left-wing agenda.

Democrats have been unveiling a very sad, uninspiring list of 2020 candidates over the past few weeks, and now have realized their only hope at success is OBSTRUCTING America's tremendous progress.
Since I declared a National Emergency at our Southern Border, 16 liberal states have already filed a lawsuit to block it, and now the Democrats in the House are calling to repeal the order. TOTAL DISGRACE!
What was once a respectable political party is now the Democratic party of: wide-open borders, 90% taxes, full-term abortion, the Green New Disaster, anti-military policies, and doing anything they can to ensure America's failure.
I can confidently say that hard-working American Patriots absolutely despise these liberal talking points, but the Hollywood Elites (see Sunday's pathetic Oscar Awards display) LOVE these policies and are maxing out BIG TIME to their liberal friends.

That's why I'm personally reaching out to you, as one of my top supporters, to help us keep pace and CRUSH our CRITICAL End-Of-Month goal.
Just because February is a short month, doesn't mean we don't have HUGE goals. 
++HYPERLINK++ 
With our End-Of-Month deadline TOMORROW, please make a contribution of $5 and it will be TRIPLE-MATCHED.

I was one of the conservatives who believed President Trump could win the White House. The energy in our country in October 2016 was like nothing I had ever witnessed. I knew the polls were missing something.
I want you to know that I'm not one to be swayed by doomsday polls put out by the media. But I must admit that I'm concerned that our House Majority could be in jeopardy.
Races are too close for comfort. The Left is fired up. With our final end-of-month deadline coming up, this is our moment to fight or lose.

Please make a contribution to help the President invest in the most important races that will decide the fate of the people's House -- and ultimately even the White House.

As Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi would be third in line for the presidency.
All work that has been done to secure funding for the wall, provide resources for border security, slash Obama's regulations, grow our economy, cut taxes, and protect miners, farmers, and all workers would be lost.
Instead, Democrats would use the people's House as a weapon to attack President Trump.

The Democrat way is very simple: complain, obstruct, do nothing to help America, and then ask for your vote 2 years later. NO MORE!

Even before the State of the Union Address, Cryin' Chuck and Democrats criticized President Trump's speech.
During his historic State of the Union Address he had a very clear message for Democrats like Cryin' Chuck, who only obstruct:

 'Victory is not winning for our party, victory is winning for our country.'
It's called AMERICA FIRST!
Here are some of the highlights from last night's historic State of the Union Address:
  - President Trump shared critical details about the CRISIS at our Southern Border, and finally exposed Democrats for their lies and obstruction.

  - He described our BOOMING ECONOMY and laid out a clear vision of our plan for continued American Greatness.

  - And he expressed a message of unity that ALL AMERICANS should be proud of.We know Democrats will criticize the speech. We know the Mainstream Media will criticize the speech. And we know the Coastal Elites will criticize the speech.
But the President doesn't care what they think. He only cares what you think, N.

The Fake News is trying to cover this up, but I'm cutting through their filter to give you the Real News.

House Intelligence Committee concluded that there is 'NO EVIDENCE' that the Trump campaign 'colluded, coordinated or conspired with Russia.'

(04/27/18)

Can the media finally admit that YOU -- the American people -- are the real reason we won this election?
The most insulting thing about this witch hunt is that it undermines the millions of American voters who poured their hearts into a movement to fight for a better future.
I need you to keep fighting for our movement. Please step up today to renew your Sustaining Membership for 2018.

>From the moment my husband, Donald, placed his hand on the bible and took the oath of office to serve as America's President, he has worked nonstop to deliver on his promises.
Democrats and the opposition media are doing everything they possibly can to discredit Donald with false accusations by spreading their fake news and making it appear that he does not have the support of America's voters.

++HYPERLINK++ 
That is why I am asking that you join my husband as he fights for our nation by signing your Presidential Pledge of Support. 

Up until a few years ago, I never envisioned that I would one day serve our nation as First Lady.
Everything you and I believe in regarding the future of America is on the line in the coming months. This is a battle we must win together.
I'm asking you and other Americans across the country to personally register your support and help prove that the Democrats and media are wrong.

++HYPERLINK++

Everyone in the media is trying to tell Republican candidates how to win. But these are the same people who said we would lose in 2016.
Instead, I want to ask the voters themselves. With only 5 days until the election, I need YOUR input so that I can show every Republican running for office which issues are most important.

With another caravan of illegal immigrants marching toward our border, there has never been a more important time for Republicans to declare our platform before the midterms.

Ever since our incredible movement began, the Democrats have been against us.

First, they REFUSED to put the safety of Americans at our Southern Border above their own political interests, and then they disinvited me from speaking at the PEOPLE'S State of the Union on the original date.
As your Commander-In-Chief, I will always put the safety of America First, and whether they like it or not, I'm delivering YOUR State of the Union Address on February 5th.

Friend, now I hope you will be there for my RE-ELECTION campaign in 2020 as we KEEP FIGHTING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Our big announcement comes on the day of a CRITICAL reporting deadline. Will you step up with a contribution of ANY amount to show you're ready to fight for another BIG win in 2020?

CONTRIBUTE $1  You've seen how BRUTAL the fake news has been. You've seen how rabid the Democrats have become. We couldn't wait until 2019 to start fighting for re-election. We had to start NOW!

I don't care how many more lies they spread about me and my family...
I don't care how many more cowards write fake books to try and distract the people...

Because there is NOTHING they can do to stop us from our mission to SAVE America.

CONTRIBUTE $1  We have now entered a CRITICAL election year. The media is hoping to claim that 2018 will be a referendum on President Trump.
It's up to us to prove them WRONG. Let's show them that we are starting off the year stronger than we started his inauguration.
America is waking up to the fake news. We're waking up to the lies liberals have been feeding our country for decades. We are still fighting to take our country, and we will not rest.

Please renew your 2018 Sustaining Membership for $1, and let's prove that President Trump has the FULL backing of the American people.

Over 500,000 supporters stepped up. And if they never did, I would not be writing to you today as your President. I will never forget these patriots.
So today I ask you to make one more EMERGENCY contribution and again be remembered as someone who believed in us despite the media's predictions.

And tonight we have the opportunity to prove them wrong once again. Tonight is our chance to write the greatest American comeback story in the history of politics.
My team is going to be giving me a list of Election Day Donors who stepped up to help fund an emergency pool of resources as game-day decisions are made in critical states between now and the close of polls.
I'll be on calls with our political director all day, determining which states need last-minute resources.

Your contribution today will be a sign of unwavering support at the final hour, and will help fund an emergency pool of resources used for last-minute decisions based on our internal polls.

Democrats have been unveiling a very sad, uninspiring list of 2020 candidates over the past few weeks, and now have realized their only hope at success is OBSTRUCTING America's tremendous progress.
Since I declared a National Emergency at our Southern Border, 16 liberal states have already filed a lawsuit to block it, and now the Democrats in the House are calling to repeal the order. TOTAL DISGRACE!
What was once a respectable political party is now the Democratic party of: wide-open borders, 90% taxes, full-term abortion, the Green New Disaster, anti-military policies, and doing anything they can to ensure America's failure.
I can confidently say that hard-working American Patriots absolutely despise these liberal talking points, but the Hollywood Elites (see Sunday's pathetic Oscar Awards display) LOVE these policies and are maxing out BIG TIME to their liberal friends.

That's why I'm personally reaching out to you, as one of my top supporters, to help us keep pace and CRUSH our CRITICAL End-Of-Month goal.
Just because February is a short month, doesn't mean we don't have HUGE goals.

He ran to be YOUR VOICE. And today, it is RINGING ACROSS OUR NATION.

Friend,
President Trump gave an incredible first State of the Union Address. He spoke of unity, a better future for all Americans, and called for obstructionists on both sides of the aisle to stop playing political games and get to work.
However, Nancy Pelosi, who called the President's historic tax cuts 'Armageddon' and said his speech would be 'slobbering,' obviously felt differently
++HYPERLINK++ 

Her reaction speaks for itself.
While millions of Americans are seeing higher wages, simplified taxes, and are keeping more of their hard-earned money, Democrats continue to push and praise out-of-touch leaders like Nancy Pelosi.

They're coming after us in 2018, and I am counting on your support to make sure Nancy Pelosi NEVER becomes speaker again.
If you're with me, and want to elect more conservatives that will vote YES on the President's BOLD America First agenda that WORKS for the American people, please make a contribution below:

Friend,
We're sick of hearing the media say that our movement is losing support. Today that ends.
YOU can prove them wrong while the world watches my father's first official State of the Union Address.
The official Donald J. Trump for President livestream of the speech will display the names of all the patriots who chose to make a contribution for the world to see.
++HYPERLINK++ 
++HYPERLINK++ 
CONTRIBUTE $1  Even if you choose to only give $1, the proof of your support will send shockwaves around the world as they see every American who proudly stands behind our President.
As the President has said so many times before, it's not the size of your gift that matters, but the fact that you stepped up to have a stake in the future of our country.
This is a movement. It's not about just one of us. It's about ALL OF US united behind our shared vision to Make America Great Again!

++HYPERLINK++ 
So before the speech, make your contribution of just $1 to have it displayed right under the livestream of the President's State of the Union. 
Thanks,

++HYPERLINK++

Friend,
Democrats have NOTHING to offer America.
Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer's only policy -- backed up by the fake news media -- is to 'resist' this President, 'resist' border security, 'resist' free speech, and 'resist' economic growth.
But above all, they're resisting what YOU -- the American people -- voted for.

With the liberal machine coming after everything we believe in, the President is coming to YOU with an urgent request to make a critical end-of-month contribution before the FEC-mandated deadline.
++HYPERLINK++ 
CONTRIBUTE $1  You may not think $10 or $15 makes a difference, but it does.
Millions of American patriots have united their voices to enact GREAT change in our country. WE overcame the liberal machine in November 2016, and we can do it again in 2018.
YOU created this movement, and you're the one we RELY on at everystep to support President Trump as the media wages its rage-fueled campaign against us.
The Left has embraced a platform that ONLY the brainwashed, out-of-touch Hollywood elites could stand behind - which is why President Trump wants to make sure that our America First movement ALWAYS puts YOU, the patriotic citizens of this country, FIRST.
Now President Trump needs you on his side MORE THAN EVER.

++HYPERLINK++ 
Please consider making a critical end-of-month contribution of just $1 BEFORE February 28 at 11:59PM.

The mainstream media doesn't want to report on America's great comeback...
...So you and I will get the news out ourselves. That's why I wrote a book called 'Trump's America' detailing the revolutionary work President Donald J. Trump has done to Make America Great Again!
I'm personally signing copies of my book -- and I'd love to mail you one. 
++HYPERLINK++ 
All I ask is that you make a contribution of $50 to the President's efforts to elect true conservative champions of our agenda this November. 
++HYPERLINK++ ++RECIPIENT_FIRNAME++ you've been such a loyal and committed supporter. I want you to know that I'm fighting alongside you every step of the way.
Our hard work is paying off. We are winning the fight.

++HYPERLINK++ 
Please make a contribution of $50, and I would be honored to sign a copy of my book for you.

I just finished touring the prototypes of the wall.
I wanted all the major media networks to be forced to show the country that we are serious about delivering on our PROMISE to BUILD THE WALL.
The prototypes are done. Our great American workers are ready to start building. The House has passed our bill to build the wall. Now it's time to get the liberal obstructionists in the Senate to do their job and PASS OUR BILL.
++HYPERLINK++ 
TELL THE SENATE: BUILD THE WALL 

Please confirm your information below:
++HYPERLINK++ ++RECIPIENT_FULLNAME++ 

++HYPERLINK++ 
++RECIPIENT_EMAIL++ 
++HYPERLINK++ 
 SIGN YOUR NAME   

Please sign the petition by 11:59 PM tonight and demand the Senate to build the wall.
Never forget how powerful your voice is. It's only because of the millions of petitions we sent the Democrats that they finally opened back up the government after shutting it down to protect illegal immigrants.
You were the reason we won in 2016. You will be the reason why one of todays prototypes will become the wall that STOPS illegal immigration.

If we lose our borders, we lose our country.

++HYPERLINK++ 
So please, add your name to tell liberal obstructionists in the Senate to BUILD THE WALL.

President Trump promised you that he would bring Christmas back to the White House -- and what better way to celebrate than by sharing YOUR personal message with the First Family.

Our wonderful First Lady has been working so hard to decorate the White House for this joyous time of year.

She and the President know that the Christmas spirit is an integral part of our countrys traditions.

We hope that youll join in on the Christmas festivities led by the President and Melania by signing the Official First Family Christmas Card.

Please sign the Official First Family Christmas Card in the NEXT HOUR to add your personal message.

Thank you,

More and more Americans are saying they approve of our agenda to Make America Great Again for one simple reason
...They see firsthand the actual results of our agenda.
The economy is growing. Jobs are coming back. The Supreme Court is ruling in favor of America. Paychecks are rising. Manufacturing is experiencing an American revival. Optimism in our future is soaring. 

 As I said at CPAC, 'America is back.'
Now let's dream EVEN bigger and bolder. Let's truly be able to say we made America great again!

Please contribute just $1 toward our June goal before the FEC deadline. 
Thank you,
