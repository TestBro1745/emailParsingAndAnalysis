It would mean a lot if you could make a contribution before it ends.CONTRIBUTE ++HYPERLINK++ Brothers, and Friends -There is a good reason the political and financial establishment of this country are gearing up to stop our campaign:It is because we are going to win.And the reason we are going to win is because we are telling the truth about the reality of American life today.We are talking about a reality in which almost all of the wealth and income in this country is going to the top 1 percent.We are talking about a dysfunctional health care system that prioritizes the profits of healthy industry CEOs and stock prices over the need to provide quality care for everyone in a cost-effective way.We are talking about the tragedy for our nation that hundreds of thousands of bright young people who have the desire and ability to get a college education will not be able to do so because their families lack the money.We are talking about a reality where the top 25 hedge fund managers in this country make more money than the combined salaries of every kindergarten teacher and billionaires get huge tax breaks while our children get broken chairs, flooded classrooms and inadequate support staff in their schools.We are talking about a fossil fuel industry that continues to make huge profits while their carbon emissions destroy the planet for our children and grandchildren.We are talking about a corrupt system of campaign finance that allows a few wealthy individuals and corporations to buy our candidates and our elections. Today, virtually no piece of legislation can get passed unless it has their approval.The billionaire class in this country has never had it so well, and they see us as an existential threat to their profits and to their way of life. And they are right we are.That is why they are willing to do anything and spend unlimited amounts of money to stop our campaign.But we have something they dont have, and that is the people.And together, what we are proving is that you dont have to run around the country hustling millionaires and billionaires for money.We are funding this campaign in an unprecedented fashion by bringing millions of people together, working people, young people, all chipping in to support our campaign that promises to transform this country.But that means I need your help, because I cannot do this alone:Can you make a donation to our campaign before our monthly fundraising deadline comes to a close at midnight tonight This is important. ++HYPERLINK++ and sisters, if we stand together, there is no limit to what we can accomplish.We can defeat Donald Trump and repair the damage he has done to our country.We can create a nation that leads the world in the struggle for peace and for economic, racial, social and environmental justice.In solidarity,Bernie SandersPlease make a contribution before tonight's midnight fundraising deadline comes to an end.CONTRIBUTE ++HYPERLINK++ You can unsubscribe from this mailing list at any time: ++HYPERLINK++ ",

Reforming our broken criminal justice and immigration systems. Too radical. Not taking money from super PACs and the rich. Too radical.

        "Body": " Sign my petition: Tell Congress no more subsidies to the fossil fuel companies who lied to the American people and are destroying our planet for profit.ADD YOUR NAME ++HYPERLINK++ -We are custodians of the earth, and it would be a moral disgrace if we left to future generations a planet that was unhealthy, unsafe, and uninhabitable.Last night I joined my friend Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and others to speak about climate change at an event sponsored by the Sunrise Movement.And what I told the crowd was that climate change is an existential threat to our country, to the entire world, and that if we do not act boldly and aggressively to transform our global energy system away from fossil fuels within the next few years, there will be irreparable harm done to the planet.What significant temperature increases will mean is more drought, more crop failures, and more famine. Drinking water, already a precious commodity in many areas, will become even scarcer. Millions of people will be displaced by rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and flooding. Tropical diseases like malaria, dengue, and yellow fever will spread into parts of the world where they dont currently exist.All of this will likely lead to increased human suffering and death, but the results will be even more dire than that. The growing scarcity of basic human needs could well lead to perpetual warfare in regions around the world, as people fight over limited supplies of water, farmland, and other natural resourcesI want to stress something I was laughed at for saying during the 2016 campaign, and that is that climate change is the greatest national security threat facing our country today.And if we are going to be honest about combating climate change, it is necessary for us to understand that we have an economy that is rigged and a political system that is profoundly corrupt.In other words, we have a small number of incredibly powerful billionaires who exercise enormous influence over the economic and political life of the country.There are a lot of parallels between what the fossil fuel industry is doing today and the tobacco industry of 50 years ago. Decades ago, large profitable corporations denied that cigarette smoking causes cancer and other diseases. Today, the fossil fuel industry, making billions every year, denies what carbon emissions are doing to our planet. They lie, lie and lie, and spend hundreds of millions of dollars to buy politicians who echo their lies.In the last decade alone, the oil and gas industry has pumped more than $700 million worth of campaign contributions into federal, state and local elections. In that same time, they spent more than $1.5 billion lobbying in Washington, D.C.The fossil fuel industry has been well rewarded for their spending. An IMF report found that direct and indirect subsidies for coal, oil and gas in the U.S. reached $649 billion in 2015.Maybe providing massive support to an industry that is destroying our planet makes sense to some people, but it damn well does not make sense to me.And here is even more. As a result of Trumps tax cuts, nearly half of the Fortune 500 companies that paid zero in taxes last year were in the fossil fuel and utility industry.Lets be clear: it is time to end all subsidies and tax breaks for the oil and gas companies.These companies lied to the American people about the very existence of climate change and committed one of the greatest frauds in the history of our country.Add your name if you agree: Congress should no longer provide subsidies to the fossil fuel companies who lied to the American people and are destroying our planet for profit. ++HYPERLINK++ just as the tobacco industry was ultimately forced to pay for the fraud they committed the fossil fuel industry must be forced to do the same.They cannot destroy this planet with impunity.So here is the major question that we must answer: How do we take on an industry with unlimited power and resourcesAnd here in my view, is the answer.We need a political revolution. We need millions of people from one end of this country to the other to stand up and fight back to create environmental policy that works for all of us and not just the one percent.We have got an enormous amount of work in front of us. Weve got to educate. We've got to organize. And weve got to fight for political power.The one percent has unlimited wealth and influence, but at the end of the day they are just one percent. And if my arithmetic is right, there are a lot more people in the 99 percent than in the one percent.Lets bring our people together. Lets transform our energy system and lets save the planet.In solidarity,Bernie SandersADD YOUR NAME ++HYPERLINK++ You can unsubscribe from this mailing list at any time: ++HYPERLINK++ ",

They are exerting executive privilege, declaring that they will not respond to any subpoenas.President Trump seems determined to engineer a constitutional crisis. His refusal to comply with a standard congressional subpoena is completely unacceptable, especially because he has been insisting for weeks that the Mueller report fully exonerates him. If that is true, then why is he trying to block lawmakers from simply reading the full report What is he trying to hideOne of the most fundamental jobs of Members of Congress is to oversee the executive branch of the federal government. Lawmakers have a right and an obligation to read the entire Mueller report in order to perform those oversight responsibilities. The report did not reach a conclusion on whether President Trump and his administration obstructed justice and that means it is especially important for Congress to thoroughly investigate Muellers full findings. We cannot do that if the president blocks access to the report.As Donald Trump has said before, Let it come out, let the people see it\" I couldnt agree more.

        "Body": " A war in Iran would make the Iraq war look like a walk in the park. It will be an unmitigated disaster. Sign my petition: Tell Congress to pass legislation that would prohibit military action against Iran without Congressional approval.ADD YOUR NAME ++HYPERLINK++ is a truth you dont often hear in the newspapers, on television or in the halls of Congress, but it is a truth we must face, especially as the Trump administration appears to be marching us closer to armed conflict with Iran:And that truth is that far too often American intervention and the use of American military power has produced unintended consequences which have caused incalculable harm.Real American power is not demonstrated by our ability to blow things up, but our ability to forge international consensus around shared challenges.A test of a great nation is not how many wars we can engage in or how many governments we can overthrow, but how we can use our strength to resolve international conflicts in a peaceful way.And it is almost beyond impossible to imagine that after the horrors of the war in Iraq a war that upended the regional order of the Middle East and resulted in an untold loss of life that this administration would put us on such a dangerous path toward more war. But everyday we see a new story about how this administration is trying provoke conflict, like sending huge bombers to the region, or raising the possibility of sending more than 100,000 troops.Apparently for some, almost two decades of constant war is not enough.Well, unfortunately for this president and people like John Bolton who love endless wars, the constitutional authority for declaring war rests with the United States Congress not the president no matter if that president is a Democrat or a Republican.And it is long past time my colleagues in the Senate reassert that authority. That is something I tried to do with my colleagues to stop our involvement in the war in Yemen, and it is something we must do again as the president marches us toward war with Iran.Please add your name if you agree:Sign my petition: tell Congress to pass legislation that would prohibit military action against Iran without Congressional approval. ++HYPERLINK++ of the first speeches I gave in Congress was about the first war in Iraq in 1991; a war I voted against.And what I said at the time was that our challenge at that moment was not simply to begin a war which would result in tremendous suffering and death, but that the real challenge was to address international conflict without war and bloodshed.It seemed to me that it would be a terrible failing, and very ominous for our future, if we could not solve that problem non-violently when virtually the entire world was united against one small country. And that if we were not successful in that effort, all this world would have to look forward to in the future would be war, and more war, and more war.There are a number of parallels to this moment in time.Today, our most important allies are committed to preventing the possibility that Irans undemocratic regime could ever obtain a nuclear weapon.That is what the Iran deal was all about. And that was why it was such a reckless mistake for Trump to withdraw from the Iran deal, as even his own top security officials said at the time. Rather than remain united with those allies, Trump's approach has actually isolated the United States from them, undermining the important consensus that the Obama administration helped forge, and raising the possibility of conflict.And it seems to me that, once again, if we turn our backs on a non-violent solution in favor of more military conflict, that we will find ourselves in perpetual warfare. Mark my words. A war in Iran would make the Iraq war look like a walk in the park. It will be an unmitigated disaster.So Congress must intervene and utilize its constitutional authority before its too late.And I hope youll make your voice heard if you agree:Sign my petition: tell Congress to pass legislation that would prohibit military action against Iran without Congressional approval.Throughout the world today, hundreds of millions of people live in abysmal poverty while the arms merchants of the world grow increasingly rich as governments spend trillions of dollars on weapons and war.Our job is to offer a different vision a vision that one day human beings on this planet will live in a world where international conflicts are resolved peacefully, not by mass murder.In solidarity,Bernie SandersADD YOUR NAME ++HYPERLINK++ You can unsubscribe from this mailing list at any time: ++HYPERLINK++ ",

        "Body": " Sisters and Brothers -Yesterday evening, the U.S. Senate passed a resolution I introduced that will end our countrys support for a morally indefensible Saudi-led war in Yemen a war most Americans know little about and that Congress never voted to authorize.This bill, co-sponsored by Senators Mike Lee of Utah and Chris Murphy of Connecticut, is the first time that Congress has successfully utilized the War Powers Act, passed 45 years ago, by coming together in this way to say that the constitutional authority for declaring war rests with the United States Congress - not the president, whether that president is a Democrat or Republican.I expect that it will pass the House next, where our friend and national campaign co-chair, Congressman Ro Khanna, has introduced a similar bill.Not surprisingly, given our president's deep affection for authoritarian regimes, the White House has threatened to veto this bill if it gets to Trumps desk.So what I want to do today is make sure President Trump knows that it isnt just the United States Senate and House of Representatives that believes we should end our involvement in this humanitarian catastrophe, but the American people do as well.So I want to ask:Sign my petition: say that you support legislation that will end the United States involvement in the Saudi-led war in Yemen, a war that has caused the greatest humanitarian catastrophe on our planet today. ++HYPERLINK++ support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen has been one of the great moral stains on our nation resulting in the worst humanitarian crisis on earth.During the last several years more than 85,000 children in Yemen have starved to death, while millions more face imminent starvation.With the water infrastructure destroyed by Saudi bombs, 10,000 new cases of cholera occur each week as people are unable to find clean drinking water.And the truth is, by continuing to back Saudi Arabias war in Yemen with weapons, aerial refueling, and targeting assistance, the United States has been complicit in this humanitarian catastrophe one that no one can seriously claim is actually making us any safer.So yesterday, with our vote in the Senate, we said enough is enough. Enough killing. Enough starvation. Enough destruction. This is the time to tell Saudi Arabia, and indeed the rest of the world, that we will no longer be a partner to the horrific crisis in Yemen.Next, I expect the House of Representatives will do the same.Then it goes to the presidents desk. But before it does, I want to make a request:Please sign my petition: say that you support legislation that will end the United States involvement in the Saudi-led war in Yemen, a war that has caused the greatest humanitarian catastrophe on our planet today. ++HYPERLINK++ historic importance of this resolution is not only moving the United States out of that horrific war, but having the country see that their elected representatives are about to take back their constitutional responsibilities on the issues of war, one of the most important functions that the United States Congress has.Thank you for adding your name.In solidarity,Bernie Sanders You can unsubscribe from this mailing list at any time: ++HYPERLINK++ ",

        "Body": " Friends - We are facing a bit of a dilemma on our campaign. We still have more individual donations than anyone else. By a lot. But the truth is that our average contribution has been steadily in decline. You may recall $27 was our average during the 2016 campaign. So far this month it's about $16. Here's why this is a hurdle for our campaign: for each $2,800 max-out check one of our opponents receives from a wealthy campaign contributor, we must receive 175 donations to keep up. There are two ways we can close the gap: A higher number of individual donations Donations made in slightly larger amounts So far on this campaign, most people making a contribution for the first time are donating $3. Today, if you're able, we'd like to ask if you can chip in $10 to help build the organization required to win. Most of our campaign's funding comes as a result of emails like this one, so that's why we're asking you directly: Can you make a $10 contribution to our campaign today? If we're in this together, we will win this primary, defeat Trump, and transform our country. ++HYPERLINK++ Bernie is very proud of the way we are funding this campaign. In fact, he is thrilled that our average donation is lower than it was in 2016. It means that this is truly a grassroots campaign built by a record number of people donating small-dollar contributions. Thank you for chipping in to make that possible.

        "Body": " Bernie Sanders Jane and I want to take this opportunity to wish you and yours a very healthy and happy new year.It goes without saying that 2019 will be a pivotal and momentous time for our country and the entire planet. As you know, there is a monumental clash now taking place between two very different political visions. Not to get you too nervous, but the future of our country and the world is dependent upon which side wins that struggle.The bad news is that in the United States and other parts of the world, the foundations of democracy are under severe attack as demagogues, supported by billionaire oligarchs, work to establish authoritarian type regimes. That is true in Russia. That is true in Saudi Arabia. That is true in the United States. While the very rich get much richer these demagogues seek to move us toward tribalism and set one group against another, deflecting attention from the real crises we face.The good news is that, all across this country, people are getting politically involved and are fighting back. They are standing up for economic, political, social and racial justice.In the last year we saw courageous teachers, in some of the most conservative states in the country, win strikes as they fought for adequate funding for education.We saw low paid workers at Amazon, Disney and elsewhere undertake successful struggles to raise their wages to a living wage at least $15 an hour.We saw incredibly courageous young people, who experienced a mass shooting in their school, lead successful efforts for commonsense gun safety legislation.We saw diverse communities stand together in the fight against mass incarceration and for real criminal justice reform.We saw tens of thousands of Americans, from every walk of life, take to the streets and demand that politicians respond to the global crisis of climate change.And that revitalization of American democracy spilled over into the political process. In the recent mid-term elections we experienced the highest voter turnout in years. Democrats won 40 new seats in Congress, seven governor's races and hundreds of seats in state legislatures. Most importantly, at the local, state and federal level, we saw young and progressive first time candidates - often women and people of color - pulling off major victories.As we enter 2019, it seems to me that we must mount a two-pronged offensive. First, we must vigorously take on the lies, bigotry and kleptocratic behavior of the most irresponsible president in the modern history of our country. In every way possible, we must stand up to the racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia and religious intolerance of the Trump administration.But fighting Trump is not enough.The truth is that despite relatively low unemployment, tens of millions of Americans struggle daily to keep their heads above water economically as the middle class continues to shrink.While the rich get richer, 40 million live in poverty, millions of workers are forced to work two or three jobs to pay the bills, 30 million have no health insurance, one in five cannot afford their prescription drugs, almost half of older workers have nothing saved for retirement, young people cannot afford college or leave school deeply in debt, affordable housing is increasingly scarce, and many seniors cut back on basic needs as they live on inadequate Social Security checks.Our job, therefore, is not only to oppose Trump but to bring forth a progressive and popular agenda that speaks to the real needs of working people. We must tell Wall Street, the insurance companies, the drug companies, the fossil fuel industry, the military-industrial-complex, the National Rifle Association and the other powerful special interests that we will not continue to allow their greed to destroy this country and our planet.Politics in a democracy should not be complicated. Government must work for all of the people, not just the wealthy and the powerful. As a new House and Senate convene next week, it is imperative that the American people stand up and demand real solutions to the major economic, social, racial and environmental crises that we face. In the richest country in the history of the world, here are some (far from all) of the issues that I will be focusing on this year. What do you think How can we best work togetherProtect American democracy: Repeal Citizens United, move to public funding of elections and end voter suppression and gerrymandering. Our goal must be to establish a political system that has the highest voter turnout in the world and is governed by the democratic principle of one person - one vote.Take on the billionaire class: End oligarchy and the growth of massive income and wealth inequality by demanding that the wealthy start paying their fair share of taxes. We must rescind Trump's tax breaks for billionaires and close corporate tax loopholes.Increase Wages: Raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, establish pay equity for women and revitalize the trade union movement. In the United States, if you work 40 hours a week, you should not live in poverty.Make health care a right: Guarantee health care for everyone through a Medicare for All program. We cannot continue a dysfunctional healthcare system which costs us about twice as much per capita as any other major country, and leaves 30 million uninsured.Transform our energy system: Combat the global crisis of climate change which is already causing massive damage to our planet. In the process we can create millions of good paying jobs as we transform our energy system away from fossil fuel and into energy efficiency and sustainable energy.Rebuild America: Pass a $1 trillion infrastructure plan. In the United States we must not continue to have roads, bridges, water systems, rail transport, and airports in disrepair.Jobs for All: There is an enormous amount of work to be done throughout our country from building affordable housing and schools to caring for our children and the elderly. 75 years ago, FDR talked about the need to guarantee every able-bodied person in this country a good job as a fundamental right. That was true in 1944. It is true today.Quality Education: Make public colleges and universities tuition free, lower student debt, adequately fund public education and move to universal childcare. Not so many years ago, the United States had the best education system in the world. We much regain that status again.Retirement Security: Expand Social Security so that every American can retire with dignity and everyone with a disability can live with security. Too many of our elderly, disabled and veterans are living on inadequate incomes. We must do better for those who built this country.Women's rights: It is a woman, not the government, who should control her own body. We must oppose all efforts to overturn Roe v. Wade, protect Planned Parenthood and oppose restrictive state laws on abortion.Justice for All: End mass incarceration and pass serious criminal justice reform. We must no longer spend $80 billion a year locking up more people than any other country. We must invest in education and jobs, not jails and incarceration.Comprehensive immigration reform: It is absurd and inhumane that millions of hardworking people, many of whom have lived in this country for decades, are fearful of deportation. We must provide legal status to those who are in the DACA program, and a path to citizenship for the undocumented.Social Justice: End discrimination based on race, gender, religion, place of birth or sexual orientation. Trump cannot be allowed to succeed by dividing us up. We must stand together as one people.A new foreign policy: Let us create a foreign policy based on peace, democracy and human rights. At a time when we spend more on the military than the next ten countries combined, we need to take a serious look at reforming the bloated and wasteful $716 billion annual Pentagon budget.In the New Year, let us resolve to fight like we have never fought before for a government, a society and an economy that works for all of us, not just those on top.Wishing you a wonderful new year,Bernie Sanders You can unsubscribe from this mailing list at any time: ++HYPERLINK++ ",

        "Body": " Sisters, Brothers, and Friends -It was only a few years ago that the corporate media and political establishment laughed us off when we said it was past time to guarantee health care as a right for all.Well, thats not the case anymore. Because right now Medicare for All is not only supported by the majority of Americans, it is also an idea embraced by many Democrats, including most running for president.Let me be very clear: that did not happen by accident. It happened because of you. Because of us.Together we have made incredible progress on this issue, but we are not finished yet.Today I am reintroducing Medicare for All legislation in the Senate. And it's important that we send an unmistakable message to my colleagues that health care must be guaranteed as a right for all Americans.I cannot do it alone. So I am asking you directly:Add your name to say you support my Medicare-for-All, single-payer health care bill. Health care is a human right, not a privilege. ++HYPERLINK++ will come as no surprise that the health insurance and pharmaceutical companies do not like our Medicare for All plan.They would rather continue making billions in profits off a dysfunctional health care system that leaves millions of Americans struggling to get the care and prescription drugs that they need.It has never made sense to me that our health care system is primarily designed to make huge profits for multibillion-dollar insurance companies, drug companies, hospitals, and medical equipment suppliers. Health care is not a commodity. It is a human right. And the goal of a sane health care system should be to keep people well, not to make stockholders rich.So today we say to the private health insurance companies, whether they like it or not, the United States will join every other major country on earth and guarantee health care to all people as a right. All Americans are entitled to go to the doctor when they're sick and not go bankrupt after staying in the hospital.If we are serious about providing high-quality and affordable health care to every man, woman, and child in this country, the only real solution is a Medicare for All, single-payer system that provides health care to ALL Americans.Although we have seen growing support in Congress, the truth is that we are still taking on much of the political and financial establishment in this fight. There are many who still believe universal health care is a radical idea. But what they will soon realize is that this is a struggle whose time has come.Today, as I re-introduce legislation in the Senate, we must send a powerful message that we are prepared to fight for and win Medicare for All. The only way we will win is if we are united and prepared to fight on this issue.Let's show we're in this together:Add your name in support of my Medicare for All bill if you believe it's past time for our country to guarantee health care as a right. ++HYPERLINK++ ideas are winning, and today it is important that we show we are as committed to this fight as ever.In solidarity,Bernie Sanders You can unsubscribe from this mailing list at any time: ++HYPERLINK++ ",

        "Body": " Sisters and Brothers -First, thank you very much for the great support you've given our campaign since we announced six weeks ago. During that period more than 1 million people have agreed to roll up their sleeves and volunteer, more than 500,000 have made financial contributions and tens of thousands have attended our campaign rallies in states throughout the country.We're off to a great start but if we're going to win the Democratic nomination, defeat Trump and transform our country, there's a heck of a lot more that needs to be done.I don't have to tell you that this is a pivotal and momentous time for our nation and for the entire planet, and that there is a monumental clash taking place right now between two very different political visions.And not to get you too nervous, but the future of our country and the world is dependent upon which side wins that struggle.That means that if there has ever been a time in American history when our people must stand together in the fight for economic, social, racial and environmental justice - now is that time. In other words, we need to create an unprecedented grassroots political movement.On April 27, we take our next big step in that effort. On April 27 we are going to do something you will remember decades from now.That is the day we are hosting Organizing Kickoff events in every state in the country, events which will lay the foundation for our grassroots campaign.And what I am asking you to do today is to say that you will host one of these events.Now, I understand that maybe many of you have never hosted an event like this before, but not only is it critically important, it is also quite easy. I know that you can do it, because tens of thousands of people did it successfully as part of our last campaign. And shortly after you add your name to say that you will, a member of our team will reach out to make sure you have any support you need along the way.This is the means by which we bring millions of Americans together to help transform our society. So what do you sayPlease add your name to say youre willing to host an Organizing Kickoff event on April 27. If we are organized, if we can bring millions of people into our movement, were going to win this election. So please, say youre in. ++HYPERLINK++ a vibrant democracy based on the principles of justice has never been easy. And in these dangerous and unprecedented times, it may be more difficult than ever.But we are going to defeat Donald Trump and transform this country not because I am a billionaire or because we have a super PAC funded by billionaires. We are going to win this election and transform this country because we will put together the strongest grassroots coalition in the history of American politics.I have said it before and I will say it again: real change always takes place from the bottom on up, not the top on down. Thats the kind of process I will always fight for on this campaign and in the White House because it is what I believe in from the bottom of my heart.We start at the community level, then we go to the state level, and then the national level. And today I am asking you to be an integral part of that effort, because ultimately creating change starts with you. So I am asking:Add your name to say youll host an Organizing Kickoff event on April 27: ++HYPERLINK++ April 27, we are going to bring people together from all across this country to take the next step in building an unprecedented grassroots movement from coast to coast.

        "Body": " Sisters and Brothers -As we launch this campaign for president, you deserve to know where I come from because family history heavily influences the values that we adopt as adults.I was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, in a three-and-a-half room rent-controlled apartment. My father was a paint salesman who worked hard his entire life, but never made much money. My mother raised my brother and me.I learned a great deal about immigration as a child because my father came to this country from Poland at the age of 17, without a nickel in his pocket. He came to escape the crushing poverty that existed in his community, and to escape widespread anti-Semitism. It was a good thing that he left Poland when he did because virtually his entire family there was wiped out by Nazi barbarism.I am not going to tell you that I grew up in a home of desperate poverty. That would not be true. But what I will tell you is that coming from a lower middle class family I will never forget how money or really lack of money was always a point of stress in our home.My mothers dream was that someday our family would move out of that rent-controlled apartment to a home of our own That dream was never fulfilled. She died young while we were still living in that rent-controlled apartment.My experience as a kid, living in a family that struggled economically, powerfully influenced my life and my values. Unlike Donald Trump, who shut down the government and left 800,000 federal employees without income to pay the bills, I know what it's like to be in a family that lives paycheck to paycheck.I did not have a father who gave me millions of dollars to build luxury skyscrapers, casinos and country clubs. I did not come from a family that gave me a $200,000 allowance every year beginning at the age of 3. As I recall, my allowance was 25 cents a week.But I had something more valuable: I had the role model of a father who had unbelievable courage in journeying across an ocean, with no money in his pocket, to start a new and better life.I did not come from a family of privilege that prepared me to entertain people on television by telling workers: Youre fired. I came from a family who knew all too well the frightening power employers can have over everyday workers.I did not come from a politically connected family whose multinational corporation got special tax breaks and subsidies. I came from a family where my parents paid their taxes and understood the important role that government plays in a democracyI did not come from a family that could afford to send my brother and me to an elite boarding school. In fact, I was educated in high quality public schools in Brooklyn and began the first year of my college life at Brooklyn College.Having attended an excellent public college that was then virtually tuition free while living in a rent-controlled apartment, I can assure you that my family believed that government in a democratic society had a very important role to play in protecting working families.I did not come from a family that taught me to build a corporate empire through housing discrimination. I protested housing discrimination, was arrested for protesting school segregation, and attended Reverend Dr. Martin Luther Kings March on Washington for jobs and freedom.I know where I came from, and that is something I will never forget.Over the last few years, you and I and millions of Americans have stood up and fought for justice in every part of our society. And we've had some successes.Together, as billionaires and large corporations have attacked unions, destroyed pensions, deregulated the banks, and slashed wages, we have succeeded in raising the minimum wage to $15 in states and cities across the country. We have also forced large corporations like Amazon and Disney to do the same. And we have supported teachers who successfully stood up for their kids in strike after strike after strike.Together, as the forces of militarism have kept us engaged in unending wars, we have stood arm-in-arm to fight back. For the first time in 45 years, we have utilized the War Powers Act to move us forward in ending the horrific Saudi-led war in Yemen.Together, as so many of our young people have received criminal records for nonviolent offenses, we have fought to end the war on drugs, and have seen state after state decriminalize marijuana, and have seen communities expunge the criminal records of those arrested on these charges.Lets be honest: while we have won some victories, our struggles have not always been successful. But I am here to tell you, that because of all the work we have done, we are now on the brink of winning not just an election, but transforming our country.When we are in the White House, we will enact a federal jobs guarantee, to ensure that everyone is guaranteed a stable job. There is more than enough work to be done in this country. Let's do it.When we are in the White House we will attack the problem of urban gentrification and build the affordable housing our nation desperately needs.When we are in the White House we will end the decline of rural America, reopen those rural hospitals that have been closed, and make sure that our young people have decent jobs so they do not have to leave the towns they grew up in and love.When we are in the White House, we will move aggressively to end the epidemic of gun violence in this country and pass the common sense gun safety legislation that the overwhelming majority of Americans want. People who should not have guns will not have guns.When we are in the White House, we are going to address not only the disparities of wealth and income that exist in our country, but we will address the racial disparities of wealth and income. We are going to root out institutional racism wherever it exists. Not only will we end voter suppression, we are going to make it easier for people to vote - not harder.When we are in the White House, we are going to protect a womans right to control her own body. That is her decision, not the government's.Make no mistake about it, this struggle is not just about defeating Donald Trump. This struggle is about taking on the incredibly powerful institutions that control the economic and political life of this country. Im talking about Wall Street, the insurance companies, the drug companies, the military-industrial complex, the prison-industrial complex, the fossil fuel industry and a corrupt campaign finance system that enables billionaires to buy elections.Brothers and sisters, we have an enormous amount of work ahead of us. But I believe if we stand together, if we don't allow Trump and his friends to divide us up, there is nothing we cannot accomplish.In solidarity,Bernie Sanders You can unsubscribe from this mailing list at any time: ++HYPERLINK++ ",

I hope youll give me a chance to explain why this request is so important especially in light of some recent news.The truth is, in the campaign we are not only taking on Donald Trump, his super PAC, and the huge fundraising head start he has amassed.We are taking on very powerful corporate forces, like the insurance and pharmaceutical industries and their well-financed front-groups like the Partnership for Americas Health Care Future.This groups members arent patients or consumers or people impacted by our current health care system they are insurance companies and the pharmaceutical industrys lobbying group. And they are already running very large advertising campaigns all over the country attacking us and the ideas that power our campaign specifically, ideas like Medicare for All.But let us be absolutely clear: These frantic attempts to derail our progress are a sign that we are winning.

If there has ever been a time in American history when our people must stand together in the fight for economic, social, racial and environmental justice - now is that time.The bad news is that we have a president who is a fraud, a pathological liar and a racist. The good news is that the American people are standing up, fighting back and are demanding fundamental changes in our economic and political system.The bad news is that we have a president who just shut down the government for 35 days because he couldn't get an expensive and unneeded wall with Mexico, while 800,000 federal employees tried to survive without paychecks.The good news is that federal workers and their unions fought back and, with the airline industry facing growing delays because of worker sickouts, the president relented and reopened the government.The bad news is that the scientific community is telling us that climate change is the greatest global crisis facing the planet, while we have a president and Republican leadership who are working overtime for more deregulation of the fossil fuel industry - and even more carbon emissions.The good news is that at the grassroots level, here and around the world, more and more people, led by the younger generation, understand that we need bold initiatives to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels and into energy efficiency and sustainable energy.The bad news is that at a time of massive wealth and income inequality, when the 3 wealthiest Americans own more wealth than the bottom half of our country and 46% of all new income is going to the top 1%, we have a president and Republican leadership who want even more tax breaks for billionaires.The good news is that, poll after poll, shows that the American people want the wealthiest people in this country and the largest profitable corporations to start paying their fair share of taxes. They understand that instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires we should be rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure and investing in healthcare and education.The bad news is that the middle class continues to shrink and millions of Americans today are working for starvation wages. Many of them are forced to work two or three jobs just to survive and receive little or no family leave or vacation time.The good news is that in state after state, community after community, legislation is being passed guaranteeing a living wage to all workers -$15 an hour. It is very likely that a $15 per hour minimum wage bill will be passed by the U.S. House of Representatives this session. My Senate bill for $15 per hour now has 31 cosponsors.The bad news is that we have a corrupt political system that allows billionaires to spend unlimited sums of money to elect candidates who represent their interests. We also see widespread voter suppression and extreme gerrymandering.The good news is that there is overwhelming support to overturn the disastrous citizens United Supreme Court decision, and good progress is being made to strengthen our democracy. In the last election, voter turnout soared and young people participated in record-breaking numbers. In Florida, as a result of a citizen referendum, 1.4 million people who served time for a felony conviction will have their voting rights restored.The bad news is that, tragically, institutional racism continues to remain strong in the United States. The already large wealth gap between whites and blacks is growing wider. There is a massive level of racial disparity in terms of health care, education, housing, social mobility and access to capital.The good news is that the younger generation today, the future of our country, is the least racist in our history and is prepared to fight for racial justice. Further, we are seeing more and more people of color running for office - from school board to Congress - and many of them are winning. They, and all of us, will do everything possible to end the scourge of racism in the United States.The bad news is that we have a dysfunctional healthcare system which leaves 30 million Americans uninsured, even more underinsured and costs far more per capita than any other country on earth. We are also forced to pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.The good news is that the American people now overwhelmingly support a Medicare for all, single payer program which guarantees healthcare to all Americans as a right, not a privilege, Medicare for all will also expand benefits for seniors by including dental care, audiology and optical care.The bad news is that hundreds of thousands of young people are unable to afford to go to college, and millions more are leaving school deeply in debt.The good news is that cities and states across the country are moving to provide free tuition at public colleges and universities, and there is widespread support for that idea. In a highly competitive global economy the American people know that we must have the best educated workforce in the world.The bad news is that there is now a massive, well coordinated attack against women's rights. In many states it is increasingly difficult for women to exercise their constitutional right for an abortion, or to even receive the birth control they need. Pay inequality remains prevalent, as does sexual harassment on the job.The good news is that there is widespread opposition in this country to repealing Roe v. Wade, and the newly elected Congress is strongly pro-choice. Further, as a result of the effort of the women's movement, in workplaces both large and small there are now new policies in place to protect a woman's right to do her job without discrimination or harassment.The bad news is that is is that we have a criminal justice system in this country which is severely broken. We have more people in jail than any other country on earth disproportionately African-American, Latino and Native American. Unbelievably, hundreds of thousands of Americans are in prison right now simply because they cannot afford cash bail.The good news is that millions of Americans, including some conservatives, are coming together in the fight against mass incarceration, mandated minimum sentencing, the cash bail system, police brutality and the failed war on drugs. At long last, there are now district attorneys and prosecutors who want to reduce the prison population, not increase it. Americans increasingly understand that we should invest in jobs and education, not more jails and incarceration.The bad news is that we have a demagogic president who is targeting undocumented immigrants in a racist manner for cheap political gain. This is a president who ended the DACA program and has authorized the separation of tiny children at the border from their mothers.The good news is that the American people have consistently made clear their desire to see the restoration of DACA and comprehensive immigration reform and a path toward citizenship for the more than 10 million undocumented people in this country.Let me conclude by thanking all of you for standing with me in the fight for justice. We should all be extremely proud that over the last few years, on issue after issue, we have made enormous progress in advancing the progressive agenda. Ideas that, just a few years ago were considered \"radical\" or \"extreme\" are now supported by a strong majority of Americans.In these very difficult times, despair is not an option. For the sake of our kids and grandchildren, the struggle must continue. Black, white, Latino, Asian-American, Native-American, male or female, gay or straight, let us proudly stand together and create the kind of country we know we can become.In solidarity,Bernie Sanders You can unsubscribe from this mailing list at any time: ++HYPERLINK++ ",

This is how our resolution starts:There is a climate emergency which demands a massive-scale mobilization to halt, reverse, and address its consequences and causes.If you agree that climate change is an existential threat, and that we must take urgent, immediate action on this emergency, please add your name to mine right now. ++HYPERLINK++ change is real, it is caused by human activity, and it is already causing devastating harm to the United States and countries around the world.Last week, parts of Washington, DC experienced nearly unprecedented flooding because of a rain storm. Devastating storms regularly rip across the Midwest at increasing scale. Alaska had 90 degree temperatures last weekend, which was the hottest ever recorded.Yet it is not just the United States. All over the world, you see communities displaced by climate change. People suffer daily because of floods, storms, and more.Let's be clear. Failure to act decisively on climate change will mean more drought, more famine, more rising sea levels, more floods, more ocean acidification, more extreme weather disturbances, more disease and more human suffering. Climate change is about our survival of the human raceThe good news is that we now have the knowledge and technology to address climate change, and it starts with taking on the extraordinary power of the fossil fuel industry and creating an international energy system that is clean, efficient and sustainable.The bad news is that we are up against the fossil fuel industry, which is one of the most powerful political forces in the country.They spend hundreds of millions of dollars on campaigns and lobbying every election cycle to protect their interests, while they continue to lie and deny the reality of climate change. And they make billions in profits by continuing to pump, refine and burn oil, while future generations will be forced to deal with the catastrophic consequences of climate change.It is past time for the United States to call climate change what it is: an emergency that is an existential threat to humanity that requires an urgent, massive response.In doing so, we will be going against the fossil fuel industrys army of lobbyists, PACs, and bought-and-sold legislators. But that is a fight worth having.The only way that we can be successful in the fight against climate change is if the American people stand up to the fossil fuel industry and make their voices heard. So Im asking you today:Add your name if you agree the United States must declare an emergency on climate change and take immediate, large-scale action to reverse its effects. This is an existential threat. ++HYPERLINK++ have a president who not only believes that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese government, but is pursuing policies which make a frightening situation even worse. Further, we have a major political party, the Republican Party, that marches in lockstep behind the ignorance of the president.But in our campaign, we have an opportunity for the U.S. to be a leader in the global fight against climate change.Thank you for being a part of this fight.In solidarity,Bernie SandersADD YOUR NAME: ++HYPERLINK++ You can unsubscribe from this mailing list at any time: ++HYPERLINK++ ",

        "Body": " Bernie Sanders Yesterday afternoon, for the first time in the history of the United States, the U.S. Senate passed a resolution I sponsored along with Mike Lee of Utah and Chris Murphy of Connecticut, withdrawing the United States Armed Forces from an unauthorized and unconstitutional war.The margin was 56 to 41 in support of ending our involvement in the war in Yemen. That is, in my view, a number of yes votes that most people would have believed unthinkable even just a few weeks ago.Ive written to you a lot about my work to put an end to this moral and humanitarian catastrophe, so today I want to update you on what happens next, and then I am going to ask you to take action in support of that work.In order for this bill to get to President Trumps desk, it must pass the House of Representatives. Unfortunately, Speaker Paul Ryan has effectively disallowed a vote on the resolution, despite the fact it would pass with bipartisan support.So either something has to change, or the new Congress under Nancy Pelosis leadership will have to take it up again in early 2019. Meanwhile, many Yemeni children and families will die. More will suffer until we finally act and force these two sides to come to a resolution that ends this moral abomination.My hope is that if we can put enough pressure on Paul Ryan and the Republicans in Congress, something can change. And if it doesnt, the new Congress will know without question that the American people no longer want to play a part in the death and destruction in Yemen.So I am asking you to make your voice heard:Sign my petition: tell Speaker Ryan and the House of Representatives to vote on legislation that would end the United States support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen. ++HYPERLINK++ is the truth: by continuing to back Saudi Arabias war in Yemen with weapons, aerial refueling, and targeting assistance, the United States has been complicit in the worst humanitarian disaster on Earth a war which no one can seriously claim is actually making us safer.Instead, 85,000 children have starved to death, 14 million more people are on the brink of starvation, and the country is facing the worst cholera outbreak in the world. According to the United Nations, the war in Yemen has created the most severe famine in more than 100 years.And unless we use the power of this country NOT to drop more bombs and instead to bring the warring parties together, this situation will become even worse.The good news is, through our action in the Senate, we are already placing enormous amounts of pressure on Saudi Arabia pressure that has already resulted in some breakthroughs in the peace negotiations.But we must do more: The House must pass this legislation, President Trump must sign it, and we must end our involvement in a war that was never authorized, and is therefore unconstitutional.Add your name if you agree:Sign my petition: tell Speaker Ryan and the House of Representatives to vote on legislation that would end the United States support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen. ++HYPERLINK++ United States is a country that has stood for democracy and human rights throughout our existence. We should not be partnering with a country responsible for murdering a dissident in cold blood and that is leading an effort causing mass starvation and the worst humanitarian disaster on Earth.Yesterday we took one step closer toward that goal. And that is only possible because people all across the country are waking up to our involvement in Yemen and making their voices heard.In solidarity,Bernie Sanders ++HYPERLINK++ You can unsubscribe from this mailing list at any time: ++HYPERLINK++ ",

        "Body": " Two weeks ago, Senator Sanders campaign released a profoundly moving video that I'd like to share with you today. But first Id like to take a few moments to say why its so special. Theres a powerful story hidden in this video that the media team wasnt aware of when they produced it, making it all the more meaningful.The woman who appears in the final scene of this video with Bernie is no ordinary hijabi. This is our dear sister Dr. Suzanne Barakat. For those of you who don't know her story, Suzanne's younger brother Deah, his bride of six weeks Yusor, and Yusors sister Razan were brutally murdered execution style in their home in Chapel Hill, North Carolina four years ago. It was a harrowing Islamophobic hate crime that devastated her family and shook our community deeply. This encounter between Suzanne and Bernie wasn't planned. We were sitting in the ADA section next to the stage at the campaign rally in San Francisco. At the end of what was a wonderfully uplifting rally, we noticed the senator coming around the front to greet supporters after he had descended from the podium. A few of us from our group rushed up to meet him and thank him for his kind words in support of Muslims. WATCH THE VIDEO: ++HYPERLINK++ didn't get a chance to share her story with the senator in that fleeting moment, just a heartfelt thank you, a smile, and the sweetness of her son, who the senator received warmly. He didn't know who she was, nor did anyone from his media team. Our friend Basim managed to capture the precious moment in a few photos on his cell phone. We huddled around his phone afterwards in amazement. It turned out Basim had some mad iPhone photography skills. We couldn't get over how stunning his shots were. The images Basim took stayed with me well after the event. These weren't ordinary photos something about them felt iconic. As I was driving home, I recalled the stories Senator Sanders shared publicly for the first time when he launched his campaign a few weeks ago at his rally in Brooklyn, New York stories about his experience with anti-Semitism, about his family's history with the Holocaust, about his relatives who were killed by Hitler's men. And I thought about the parallels with Suzanne's story. There was so much shared experience in those photos. So much pain. So much resilience. So much love. And there was something particularly poignant about the life and innocence of her little boy amid the hate and violence and senseless killing that marked the stories his elders carried with them in these images, stories he'd one day inherit. I connected with Suzanne over the phone later that night and shared some of these thoughts with her. The meaning I saw in the photos had not been lost on her either. I suggested she share the photos on Facebook along with a reflection on the connection she shared with Senator Sanders, believing it could have an impact. The timing seemed appropriate, in light of the recent tragedy in New Zealand. It wasnt that she didn't want to, she said, but that it was painful for her to talk about. The Christchurch shootings had conjured up the trauma for her again, and she was struggling with her loss. She was going to give it some thought. This was Sunday evening. Then, Monday afternoon, I was scrolling through my timeline when, to my surprise, I saw the video on a friend's page with Suzanne and her son appearing in the thumbnail. We had no idea she was being filmed. The video highlights the exact connections between Suzanne's story and the senator's that we were contemplating. The video editors closed the film with her and her son, not knowing their family were victims of the very bigotry and Islamophobic violence Bernie speaks out against throughout the footage. They probably just thought it was a good shot of the senator with a hijabi. They couldn't have known how poignant it was to end the video with her. This feels like more than a coincidence. Suzanne and her son appearing in this video to me is a lot like the time that little birdie landed on the senator's podium when he was speaking at his Portland rally last election season. It turns out that incident took place on March 25, 2016, exactly three years ago to the date this video was released. Yes, the video was released on the exact same day. The symbolism is hard to miss. It must be another good omen. I hope youll take a moment to watch and share this moving video. It carries an important message about our fight to end hate in all its forms: ++HYPERLINK++ generations. Two different faith traditions. One common humanity, as Bernie says. Thank you, Senator Sanders, for your empathy and compassion and loving, moral leadership. To everyone else, please keep Suzanne and her family in your prayers.In solidarity, Rusha Latif--------My friend Dr. Suzanne Barakat appears in a very moving video with Senator Sanders about our fight to conquer hate.Take a couple minutes out of your day to watch and share this special video: ++HYPERLINK++ You can unsubscribe from this mailing list at any time: ++HYPERLINK++ ",

The CEO of American Express walked away with $370 million in total compensation.

Crazy. Pie-in the sky.Well, they are not saying that anymore. Because today, not only do a strong majority of Americans believe health care should be a right in this country, but it is also a mainstream Democratic Party position.That is because of you. It is because of our 2016 campaign. It is because of every petition signature, phone call, text message, social media post and donation youve made. Youve led the way. It is not because of me. It is because of us. That is the political revolution.But we still have a long way to go.So when I re-introduce this bill in just a few weeks, I want every one of my colleagues in the Senate and every member of the House to know that were ready to fight harder than ever. Help me send that message:Add your name as a Citizen Co-Sponsor of my Medicare-for-all, single-payer health care bill. When I introduce the legislation, I want it to be clear that the American people believe health care should be a right in this country. ++HYPERLINK++ as far back as I can remember, I have always been a proponent of a national health care system. It just seemed eminently fair and right.How can we call this a civilized society when some Americans have access to the best medical care in the world and others are unable to walk into a doctors office because they lack moneyHow can we tolerate a situation where the children or parents of the rich get the medical attention they need in order to stay alive, while members of working-class families, who lack health insurance, have to die or needlessly sufferor go hopelessly into debt to get the care they needIn my view, the function of a rational health care system in this country should be to provide quality care for everyone in a cost effective way, not to make health industry CEOs richer or drive up stock prices on Wall Street.Now, the insurance companies may not like our legislation and the drug companies probably wont either. They will try to make words like \"NATIONAL HEALTH CARE\" sound scary.And it will not surprise you to learn that with hundreds of billions in profits at stake, the insurance companies, drug companies and others have already announced that they will spend huge amounts of money to protect their interests as they try to defeat our efforts.But the truth is, for far too long they have been bribing the United States Congress, spending billions of dollars in lobbying and campaign contributions to make sure we maintain a dysfunctional, but profitable, approach to health care.That may scare some of the other Democrats running for president, but it should not. They may have the money, but we have something more powerful:We have the people.And when I re-introduce my Medicare for All bill in the next few weeks, it is important we make it clear that we are ready to fight harder than ever for the fundamental belief that health care should be a right for every man, woman and child in this country.Add your name: ++HYPERLINK++ your name as a Citizen Co-Sponsor of my Medicare-for-all, single-payer health care bill. When I introduce the legislation, I want it to be clear that the American people believe health care should be a right in this countrySisters and Brothers: In this pivotal moment in American history, let us lead our country forward to guarantee health care as a right and not a privilege. This is a struggle whose time has come. This is a struggle not just about health care but about the heart and soul of our country, about what we stand for as a people.It is a struggle we are winning.

And we mean it on our campaign, too.Bernie 2020 is the first-ever major presidential campaign to negotiate a contract with its workers union. Were proud of that fact, and we hope other campaigns follow suit.The right to organize as part of a union has historically been one of the surest ways for American workers to join the middle class.There are many reasons for the growing inequality in our economy, but perhaps the most significant reason for the disappearing middle class is that the rights of workers to join together and collectively bargain for better wages, benefits, and working conditions have been severely undermined.That is why it is such a disgrace for Delta to make its CEO a multi-millionaire while actively fighting its employees rights to form and join a union and to negotiate for better wages. Telling its employees to buy video games instead of joining a union is insulting to the workers, and to the idea that people should be able to make a living wage in this country.Will you call on Delta to let its workers form a union and negotiate for better wagesSign Bernies petition to Delta Airlines.Thank you for standing up for working people.In solidarity, Faiz ShakirADD YOUR NAME ++HYPERLINK++ You can unsubscribe from this mailing list at any time: ++HYPERLINK++ ",

        "Body": " This election needs to be so much more than about beating Donald Trump.It is a mistake to think that this election is simply about beating one man an aberration of a president and that everything will simply return to normal.The reality is that normal in our country before there was a President Trump still meant an immoral lack of healthcare, unlivable low wages, rampant corporate greed, a racist criminal justice system, and a corrupt political system.So, no. It is not enough to just defeat Donald Trump. Returning to normal is not acceptable.Heres how we can do much, much more than that.Below, I give you a preview of our strategy to both win the Democratic nomination, to defeat Donald Trump, and to transform our country. This is what it will take. And if you can be a part of it, please make a contribution to Bernie 2020 now so that we can build the movement needed to win the election and our issues. ++HYPERLINK++ Trust Bernie to FightWhen it comes time for campaigning, a lot of politicians tend to make big promises to voters, and then if they win, actually do what their biggest funders want them to do. Its no secret that those are often at odds with each other.There will be several people in this election who can point to polls that they may be able to defeat Donald Trump. But there is only one person who can both defeat him AND transform the country afterwards.Bernie Sanders has a lifetime of consistency on the biggest questions of our time: fighting for Medicare for All, taking on corporate power, fighting for racial justice, solving climate change, and making our country more fair for more people.You know that Bernie believes in these issues to his core. Theres no question. Hes going to stick to what he believes.We are going to make sure that every voter knows this too, because we think the way to win is with a candidate who can be trusted to fight for the right thing.Deep Investment in OrganizingHaving slick television ads alone is not going to win this election, and its certainly not going to help pass Medicare for All. The way to truly transform our country is by organizing our communities from bottom to top.We need to be out on the doors and on the phones, speaking with our friends and neighbors and classmates and coworkers. We need to build a movement of people who are deeply invested in this work, and our campaign needs to invest in that movement.If we want to win, it will require all of us together. And we think that together, our campaign is the best situated to organize the kind of movement that has never been seen before.Empowering Our Supporters (You!)This is your campaign, working in your communities, speaking with people you know. You are eager to get to work, and you know how we can win.Already, our organizing kickoff brought together 60,000 people at 4,700 events who immediately got to work contacting voters. We unveiled our voter contact app, called BERN, that lets anyone start organizing their communities. No other campaign comes close to doing that .. yet.The work to win the election and to transform our country needs to be organized by people who want to make it happen. Thats you. And so were putting our trust in you to make this organizing work in your community, and were committed to giving the resources needed to make that a reality.Unequivocal Rejection of Big MoneyYou cant change a corrupt system by taking its money.And you cant win an election against Donald Trump by relying on the billionaire class to fund your campaign and super PACs.If we are going to win this election, it needs to be with a movement funded by people donating what they can afford people making investments, $27 a time, in Bernie 2020 as a way of saying theyve had enough of the billionaire class buying our elections. ++HYPERLINK++ proud to be the campaign that is most reliant on money from small contributions. But that also means that there is no super PAC or wealthy benefactor waiting in the wings like some other candidates have so its on all of us to help fund this campaign.Challenging the Status QuoWere not going to be afraid to call out parts of the establishment that think what were doing is too radical. We know that Donald Trump is not just an aberration he is a logical conclusion of a corrupt political system that has left so many people so far behind.If all we do in this moment is try to turn back the clock to a pre-Donald Trump time in Washington, DC, we will have failed. That is simply not good enough. And we will make clear both during this campaign, and after we win during the fight to implement our agenda, that it is time for a new way of thinking.That might make some establishment types uncomfortable. Too bad.Accountability to Our MovementI may be the campaign manager of Bernie 2020, but this is not about me. Its not just about Bernie, either. Its about all of us. And because of that, I think its critically important that our work during and after this campaign is based on accountability.Were going to do what we think is necessary to win, and we also need to do what is necessary to keep our movement strong. You are as much of a part of this as I am, and Im proud to see myself as part of our movement together.Continuing the Political RevolutionThe most dangerous mistake that we can make is thinking that our work is done after Tuesday, November 3, 2020.No person in the world not Bernie Sanders, and no one else could possibly be able to implement our agenda simply by winning the election. Because when we win, the billionaire class is not going to give up easy. Pharmaceutical companies will fight us when we work to lower drug prices. Health insurance executives will do all they can to stop Medicare for All. Polluters and oil companies will go all out to stop our action on climate change. And on and on.President Bernie Sanders will need an unprecedented grassroots movement along his side each day of his presidency in order for us to actually transform our country.What We NeedSo thats our strategy to win the nomination, defeat Donald Trump, and transform our country. Its about standing up for whats right. Its about fighting the political, financial, and corporate establishments. Its about working together in our communities. And its about building a lasting movement.Im about to ask you to make a contribution, and I hope that it is clear why. But first, I want to be up front with you that our average contribution which used to be $27 has been almost half that in the last couple weeks. Its OK for now, but we would really like to see if you can dig a little deeper if youre able to.So, are you ready to get to work on this strategyContribute to Bernie 2020 now to build our campaign together in a way that no one else can. ++HYPERLINK++ you for all you do for our movement.In solidarity,Faiz Shakir Campaign Manager You can unsubscribe from this mailing list at any time: ++HYPERLINK++ ",

        "Body": " Bernie Sanders Sisters and Brothers - I am writing to let you know I have decided to run for president of the United States. I am asking you to join me today as part of an unprecedented and historic grassroots campaign that will begin with at least a million people from across the country. Please join our campaign for president on day one and commit to doing what it takes to win this election. ++HYPERLINK++ Our campaign is not only about defeating Donald Trump, the most dangerous president in modern American history. It is not only about winning the Democratic nomination and the general election. Our campaign is about transforming our country and creating a government based on the principles of economic, social, racial and environmental justice. Our campaign is about taking on the powerful special interests that dominate our economic and political life. I'm talking about Wall Street, the health insurance companies, the drug companies, the fossil fuel industry, the military industrial complex, the private prison industry and the large multinational corporations that exert such an enormous influence over our lives. Our campaign is about redoubling our efforts to end racism, sexism, homophobia, religious bigotry and all forms of discrimination. Our campaign is about creating a vibrant democracy with the highest voter turnout of any major country while we end voter suppression, Citizens United and outrageous levels of gerrymandering. Our campaign is about creating a government and economy that work for the many, not just the few. We are the wealthiest nation in the history of the world. We should not have grotesque levels of wealth inequality in which three billionaires own more wealth than the bottom half of the country. We should not have 30 million Americans without any health insurance, even more who are underinsured and a nation in which life expectancy is actually in decline. We should not have an economy in which tens of millions of workers earn starvation wages and half of older workers have no savings as they face retirement. We should not have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on Earth and a dysfunctional childcare system which is unfair to both working parents and their children. We should not have a regressive tax system in which large, profitable corporations like Amazon pay nothing in federal income taxes. Make no mistake about it. The powerful special interests in this country have unbelievable power and they want to maintain the status quo. They have unlimited amounts of money to spend on campaigns and lobbying and have huge influence over the media and political parties. The only way we will win this election and create a government and economy that work for all is with a grassroots movement the likes of which has never been seen in American history. They may have the money and power. We have the people. That is why we need one million Americans who will commit themselves to this campaign. Stand with me as we fight to win the Democratic nomination and the general election. Add your name to join this campaign and say you are willing to do the hard work necessary to transform our country. ++HYPERLINK++ You know as well as I do that we are living in a pivotal and dangerous moment in American history. We are running against a president who is a pathological liar, a fraud, a racist, a sexist, a xenophobe and someone who is undermining American democracy as he leads us in an authoritarian direction. Im running for president because, now more than ever, we need leadership that brings us together not divides us up. Women and men, black, white, Latino, Native American, Asian American, gay and straight, young and old, native born and immigrant. Now is the time for us to stand together. Im running for president because we need leadership that will fight for working families and the shrinking middle class, not just the 1 percent. We need a president who understands that we can create millions of good-paying jobs, rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and construct the affordable housing we desperately need. I'm running for president because we need trade policies that reflect the interests of workers and not multi-national corporations. We need to raise the minimum wage to a living wage, provide pay equity for women and guarantee all workers paid family and medical leave. I'm running for president because we need to understand that artificial intelligence and robotics must benefit the needs of workers, not just corporate America and those who own that technology. I'm running for president because a great nation is judged not by how many billionaires and nuclear weapons it has, but by how it treats the most vulnerable the elderly, the children, our veterans, the sick and the poor. Im running for president because we need to make policy decisions based on science, not politics. We need a president who understands that climate change is real, is an existential threat to our country and the entire planet, and that we can generate massive job creation by transforming our energy system away from fossil fuels to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. Im running for president because the time is long overdue for the United States to join every other major country on Earth and guarantee health care to all people as a right, not a privilege, through a Medicare-for-all program. Im running for president because we need to take on the outrageous level of greed of the pharmaceutical industry and lower prescription drug prices in this country. I'm running for president because we need to have the best educated workforce in the world. It is totally counterproductive for our future that millions of Americans are carrying outrageous levels of student debt, while many others cannot afford the high cost of higher education. That is why we need to make public colleges and universities tuition free and lower student debt. Im running for president because we must defend a womans right to control her own body against massive political attacks taking place at the local, state and federal level. I'm running for president because we need real criminal justice reform. We need to invest in jobs and education for our kids, not more jails and incarceration. We need to end the destructive \"war on drugs,\" eliminate private prisons and cash bail and bring about major police department reform. I'm running for president because we need to end the demonization of undocumented immigrants in this country and move to comprehensive immigration reform. We need to provide immediate legal status for the young people eligible for the DACA program and develop a humane policy for those at the border who seek asylum. I'm running for president because we must end the epidemic of gun violence in this country. We need to take on the NRA, expand background checks, end the gun show loophole and ban the sale and distribution of assault weapons. I'm running for president because we need a foreign policy which focuses on democracy, human rights, diplomacy and world peace. The United States must lead the world in improving international cooperation in the fight against climate change, militarism, authoritarianism and global wealth inequality. That is why we need at least a million people to join our campaign and help lead the movement that can accomplish these goals. Add your name to say were in this together. ++HYPERLINK++ to say, there is a lot of frightening and bad news in this world. Now, let me give you some very good news. Three years ago, during our 2016 campaign, when we brought forth our progressive agenda we were told that our ideas were \"radical\" and \"extreme.\" We were told that Medicare for All, a $15 an hour minimum wage, free tuition at public colleges and universities, aggressively combating climate change, demanding that the wealthy start paying their fair share of taxes, were all concepts that the American people would never accept. Well, three years have come and gone. And, as result of millions of Americans standing up and fighting back, all of these policies and more are now supported by a majority of Americans. Together, you and I and our 2016 campaign began the political revolution. Now, it is time to complete that revolution and implement the vision that we fought for. So here is my question for you: Will you stand with me as part of a million person grassroots movement which can not only win the Democratic primary, not only win the general election, but most importantly help transform this country so that, finally, we have a government that works for all of us and not just the few Add your name to say you will. ++HYPERLINK++ Together we can create a nation that leads the world in the struggle for peace and for economic, racial, social and environmental justice. And together we can defeat Donald Trump and repair the damage he has done to our country. Brothers and sisters, if we stand together, there is no limit to what we can accomplish.

        "Body": " Bernie Sanders Earlier this week, the United States Senate took the first step toward ending our countrys active participation in a morally indefensible war in Yemen a war most Americans know little about and that Congress never voted to authorize.Over the last several years, our support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen has been one of the great moral stains on our nation resulting in the worst humanitarian crisis on earth. During the last several years more than 85,000 children in Yemen have starved to death, while millions more of the people there face imminent starvation. With the water infrastructure destroyed by Saudi bombs, 10,000 new cases of cholera occur each week as people are unable to find clean drinking water.And what my bill, offered with Senators Mike Lee of Utah and Chris Murphy of Connecticut, says is that instead of being part of the killing in Yemen, on behalf of a despotic Saudi regime, we should be doing everything possible to create a peaceful resolution to that war and provide the kind of humanitarian help Yemenis so desperately need.With 63 votes in favor and 37 against, this is the first time in the history of the United States that the U.S. Senate has voted to advance a resolution withdrawing the United States Armed Forces from an unauthorized and unconstitutional war.And our success has a lot to do with people at the grassroots level making their voices heard on this important issue.But we still have work left to do.Next week, I expect that we have another procedural vote and then a final vote on passage of the resolution. So we cannot stop now. Not if we want to see this victory through to the end and limit our engagement in Yemen to the humanitarian and diplomatic aid needed to relieve the suffering of millions of Yemenis. Add your name if youre with me:Tell the U.S. Senate: Its time to end the United States support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen. We must make it crystal clear the American people want our country out of this horrible civil war.After a number of decades and under presidents of both parties, Republicans and Democrats have abdicated their responsibility to be the body under our Constitution that decides whether or not our country engages in war.It is not the president who gets to decide whether or not we go to war in Yemen, or Syria, or anywhere else. It is Congress.And our vote earlier this week was a big step forward in reasserting that constitutional responsibility.Not surprisingly, given our president's deep affection for authoritarian regimes, the White House has threatened to veto this bill if it gets to Trumps desk. So what I want to do today with this petition is make sure Trump knows that it isnt just the United States Senate that believes we should end our involvement in this humanitarian catastrophe, but the American people as well.So add your name:Tell the U.S. Senate: Its time to end the United States support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen.Enough is enough. Enough killing. Enough starvation. Enough destruction. This is the time to tell Saudi Arabia, and indeed the rest of the world, that we will no longer be a partner to the horrific crisis in Yemen.In solidarity,Bernie Sanders You can unsubscribe from this mailing list at any time: ++HYPERLINK++ ",

        "From": "\"Bernie Sanders\" <info@berniesanders.com>",
        "Body": " One of the great crises facing the global community today is that democracy, the right of ordinary people to control their own lives, is on the defensive while authoritarianism is growing stronger.And at its root is the fact that a handful of incredibly wealthy people are exerting enormous economic and political power over the planet. Unbelievably, in the global economy today, the top 1 percent owns more wealth than the bottom 99 percent, and a handful of billionaires own more than the bottom half of people around the world thats 3.7 billion people.That is the reality.People in our own country, and around the world, are angry and betrayed, and they feel that nobody is listening to their pain.And one of the results of that reality is that in Europe, in Russia, in the Middle East, in Asia and elsewhere we are seeing movements led by demagogues who exploit peoples fears, prejudices and grievances to achieve and hold on to power.Next week, Donald Trump is set to welcome one of those leaders into the White House: Hungarys far-right authoritarian Prime Minister, Viktor Orbn.Now, I have always found it very strange that Trump has such a hard time getting along with leaders of the worlds major democracies but feels very comfortable with authoritarians like Orbn, Putin, Xi Jinping, Bolsonaro and Mohammad bin Salman.But the truth is, while they all differ in some respects, they share a number of key attributes: hostility toward democratic norms, antagonism toward a free press, intolerance toward ethnic and religious minorities, and a belief that government should benefit their own selfish financial interests.This trend certainly did not begin with Trump, but theres no question that authoritarian leaders around the world have drawn inspiration from the fact that the leader of the worlds oldest and most powerful democracy seems to delight in shattering democratic norms.Other authoritarian states are much farther along this kleptocratic process. In Russia, it is impossible to tell where the decisions of government end and the interests of Vladimir Putin and his circle of oligarchs begin. They operate as one unit. Similarly, in Saudi Arabia, there is no debate about separation because the natural resources of the state, valued at trillions of dollars, belong to the Saudi royal family. In Hungary, far-right authoritarian leader Viktor Orbn is openly allied with Putin in Russia. In China, an inner circle led by Xi Jinping has steadily consolidated power, clamping down on domestic political freedom while it aggressively promotes a version of authoritarian capitalism abroad.So the question is: Where do we go from hereTo effectively oppose right-wing authoritarianism, we cannot simply go back to the failed status quo of the last several decades. In order to fight this trend, we need to strengthen the global coalition of progressive democrats.While authoritarians promote division and hatred, we promote unity, inclusion, and an agenda based on economic, social, racial, and environmental justice.The people of the world must come together to end the absurdity of rich and multinational corporations stashing over $21 trillion in offshore bank accounts to avoid paying their fair share of taxes and then demanding that their respective governments impose an austerity agenda on their working families.It is not acceptable that the fossil fuel industry continues to make huge profits while their carbon emissions destroy the planet for our children and grandchildren.It is not acceptable that a handful of multinational media giants, owned by a small number of billionaires, largely control the flow of information on the planet.It is not acceptable that trade policies that benefit large multinational corporations and encourage a race to the bottom hurt working people throughout the world as they are written out of public view.It is not acceptable that, with the Cold War long behind us, countries around the world spend over $1 trillion a year on weapons of destruction, while millions of children die of easily treatable diseases.In order to effectively combat the rise of the international authoritarian axis, we need a global progressive movement that mobilizes behind a vision of shared prosperity, security and dignity for all people and that addresses the massive inequality that exists, not only in wealth but in political power as well.Such a movement must be willing to think creatively and boldly about the world that we would like to see.We must take the opportunity to reconceptualize a genuinely progressive global community based on human solidarity, that recognizes that every person on this planet shares a common humanity, that we all want our children to grow up healthy, to have a good education, have decent jobs, drink clean water, breathe clean air, and live in peace.Our job is to reach out to those in every corner of the world who share these values and who are fighting for a better world.In a time of exploding wealth and technology, we have the potential to create a decent life for all people. Our job is to build on our common humanity and do everything that we can to oppose all of the forces, whether unaccountable government power or unaccountable corporate power, who try to divide us up and set us against each other.We know that those forces work together across borders. We must do the same.Thank you for reading.In solidarity,Bernie Sanders In this campaign, we are taking on very powerful interests who will do and spend whatever it takes to stop us.

He was dismissed as fringe.But then our 2016 campaign happened. And I can tell you that the reason those ideas are mainstream today is because of you.

Every single donation sends a critical message. ++HYPERLINK++ Center for American Progress is an organization whose massive annual budget is bankrolled by billionaires and corporate executives that profit from finance, pharmaceutical companies, fossil fuels, and sending American jobs overseas.

They also took hundreds of thousands of dollars from the fossil fuel pumping United Arab Emirates while the country was bombing innocent civilians in Yemen a war Bernie has led the fight to end.

        "Body": " In just a minute, I am going to ask you to make a donation to organizations that help low-income women pay for reproductive healthcare. Let me first explain why.Late last night, the Alabama legislature passed a bill that would outlaw 99% of abortions. No exemptions for rape or incest. No rights for women who dont want to be pregnant. Doctors who perform abortions could be imprisoned for 99 years.Georgia passed its own bill last week that would ban abortions after six weeks before most women know theyre pregnant. Last month Ohio signed its own version into law. And Mississippi passed its own abortion ban the month before that.Politicians should not be getting in the way of a woman and her medical decisions. These are difficult family decisions that governments should not interfere with. These bills and laws are outrageous assaults on womens rights that have a singular goal: forcing the Supreme Court to take up a case that would overturn Roe v. Wade.One of the most powerful actions that we can take in response to these bans is to fund local groups that help provide access to clinics for low-income women. These are organizations on the front lines of abortion rights making sure that women who need an abortion can afford to pay for one.Thats why Im asking you today:Will you split a contribution to three abortion support networks in Alabama, the Southeast, and across the country so that low-income women can get abortions and reproductive care Your donation will send a powerful message in support of abortion rights. ++HYPERLINK++ groups provide direct service to women who need abortions but cant afford the medical costs, transportation, or lodging required to actually get the abortion, due to the burdensome restrictions put in place by bills like this. They are always in need of additional funding, doing the critical work of caring for women who are in desperate need of help.These are the groups we are asking you to support today:Yellowhammer Fund is a group in Alabama that provides funding for medical costs, transportation, and lodging for women who get abortions at any of Alabamas three abortion clinics. Fifty-nine percent of women in Alabama dont have an abortion clinic in their county, and Yellowhammer Fund does all it can to make sure Alabama women are able to get the abortions they need.Access Reproductive Care-Southeast is a group that provides financial and logistical support for women and their families who want abortions in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee. They help women plan for their abortions, and help cover the costs associated with accessing this medical care.The National Network of Abortion Funds is an umbrella organization for local abortion groups throughout the United States groups like Yellowhammer and Access Reproductive Care-Southeast. They connect people with their local funds, and provide support to the groups themselves.When fundamental human and constitutional rights are under attack, we must respond and do the most good that we can. That starts with helping low-income women get support for the abortions they need.Please donate to these abortion support networks today. ++HYPERLINK++ you for standing with women and for abortion rights.In solidarity,Team Bernie You can unsubscribe from this mailing list at any time: ++HYPERLINK++ ",

        "Body": " Last year, the CEO of General Motors made almost $22 million in compensation nearly 300 times what the average worker at the company makes each year.At the same time, GM is closing a number of profitable plants and shipping those jobs overseas, including one in Lordstown, Ohio.I visited the Lordstown plant recently with a message for General Motors, and that is if corporations like GM think they can throw workers out on the street while theyre making billions in profits and then line up to receive even more money from federal government contracts, well that aint going to happen when I am president.We made a short video from our visit. You need to see what is happening in Lordstown. The piece is quite powerful. Watch and share it with your friends on social media:FACEBOOK ++HYPERLINK++ is an example of the horrific impact on a small town and a community when a company like General Motors gives billions of dollars in stock buybacks to make the very rich even richer while closing down plants and shipping those jobs overseas.I have always felt there is something profoundly wrong with people and businesses that have so much money yet still decide that they are willing to step over working people, many with families and young children, in order to get more and more.And what we have to decide is whether in our democracy, we are going to allow a handful of businesses on Wall Street to close down profitable plants like the one in Lordstown.What we have to decide is whether or not we should allow a company like GM which received a $50 billion bailout from the taxpayers of this country to throw thousands of productive workers out on the street.To say the least, that does not show a lot of love and gratitude.So what we are going to do on this campaign, and when I am in the White House, is tell companies like General Motors that they are going to start being good corporate citizens that their greed is going to end.We are going to tell them that they will no longer continue to treat their workers with disdain and contempt.And that starts with spreading the word about what GM is doing in places like Lordstown.So please, watch our video from Lordstown and share it on your favorite social media channels Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.FACEBOOK ++HYPERLINK++ is important. People need to see what is happening in Lordstown.Thank you for sharing their story.In solidarity,Bernie SandersSign our petition: tell Donald Trump no more federal contracts for General Motors until they stop outsourcing American jobs, including the ones in Lordstown, Ohio.ADD YOUR NAME ++HYPERLINK++ You can unsubscribe from this mailing list at any time: ++HYPERLINK++ ",

Tom Steyer announced that he's running for president, and that he plans to spend at least $100 million of his own money to try to win. Look: It's good to have a competitive primary. But here's the thing: We need our candidates to compete to have the best ideas -- not just to write themselves the biggest checks. Can you chip in to help keep our campaign's message front and center in this race? Your support matters because Elizabeth isn't self-funding. She doesn't have a Super PAC, and she doesn't want one. And we don't host any fundraisers where wealthy donors write big checks to spend time with her behind closed doors. ++HYPERLINK++ The Democratic primary shouldn't be decided by billionaires, whether they're funding Super PACs or funding themselves. If you're a billionaire, you can already buy yourself a mansion, a private island, and even a yacht to get yourself there. But you shouldn't be able to buy yourself the White House -- not without a fair fight on a level playing field. And the strongest Democratic nominee in 2020 will have a coalition that's powered by a grassroots movement. Nobody is going to write a nine-figure check -- in fact, our average donation is $28.

But first, can you give me a minute to explain why it would make a real difference to helping hit our July fundraising goal? Here's the way I see it: Our campaign is based on big ideas and a core principle -- everyone gets equal access because we're fighting for a government that works for everyone. Our democracy is not for sale, and neither is my time. So I've opted out of the unwritten rule of politics that says I'm supposed to run for office by sucking up to rich donors on Wall Street and powerful interests in Washington. I'm not hosting swanky fundraisers where you can only get in if you write a ginormous check. I'm not taking PAC money, donations from federal lobbyists, or applications from billionaires who want to run a Super PAC on my behalf. If we keep letting big money control our campaigns, the wealthy and well-connected will keep controlling Washington. And our government will keep working just for people who can afford to hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers. We're fighting to change all that by building a grassroots movement to put power in the hands of the people. And it's only possible with contributions from people like you. I'm grateful from the bottom of my heart that you're on our team. Will you make your first donation right now to help make sure we hit our goal? We're behind right now, but we can make it happen with a big push before the debate on Tuesday. ++HYPERLINK++ When we hit our fundraising goals -- dollar by dollar, month after month -- and keep building our movement -- face to face, person to person -- we show the rich and the powerful that change is coming. Sooner than they think. Billionaires, CEOs, big banks, and giant corporations won't always run the show in Washington. I've got a plan -- a bunch of plans -- to level the playing field for working people and make sure we're building a future not just for some of our kids, but all of our kids. If the rich and powerful don't like it, then tough. I don't work for them. I work for you, and I'm in this fight by your side. We've got to make big, structural change. We're going to. But it'll take a massive grassroots movement to get it done. And first, our next big test is this July fundraising deadline, and we need all hands on deck to hit our goal. If you can, please chip in $5 or whatever you can afford before Tuesday's debate. ++HYPERLINK++ Thanks for being a part of this, Elizabeth DONATE NOW: ++HYPERLINK++ Paid for by Warren for President ____________________________________________ All content 2019 Warren for President, All Rights Reserved PO Box 171375, Boston, MA 02116 ____________________________________________ This email was sent to TestBro1745@gmail.com.

        "From": "Elizabeth Warren <info@elizabethwarren.com>",
        "Body": "In 2017, life expectancy in the United States went down. Let me repeat that: Nearly two decades into the 21st century, in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, life expectancy went down. And it was largely driven by the opioid epidemic. Emergency room visits for opioid overdoses have skyrocketed. Children have lost their parents. Parents have lost their children. And only a small percentage of those suffering ever receive the treatment they need. It's a crisis. A daily emergency -- with severe consequences for communities of color, made worse by the already-wide racial gaps in who gets decent health care and who doesn't. In 2017, the number of opioid-related deaths in Baltimore was almost as high as West Virginia, the state with the highest death rate in the country -- with most death occurring in the black community. This isn't the first time we've faced a huge public health crisis -- and when we look at our history, we see a path to end the opioid epidemic. Today, in partnership with Representative Elijah Cummings, I'm rolling out the CARE Act -- a comprehensive plan to end the opioid crisis by providing the resources needed to begin treating this epidemic like the public health emergency that it is. It's modeled after the Ryan White CARE Act, which finally provided significant new, guaranteed funding to help state and local governments combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic and established a safety net for those living with the disease. The CARE Act provides resources directly to first responders, public health departments, and communities on the front lines of this crisis for prevention, treatment, and recovery services. It's $100 billion in federal funding over the next 10 years -- because that's what's needed to make sure every single person gets the treatment they need. And don't worry, we already know how to pay for it. Please add your name to join the fight against the opioid epidemic and become a citizen co-sponsor of the CARE Act today. ++HYPERLINK++ This week, I'll visit Kermit, West Virginia, a small town located along the Kentucky-West Virginia border. Kermit has been hard-hit by the opioid epidemic -- and not by accident. In just a few years, this town of only 400 people was inundated with 13 million prescription opioid pills, all delivered to a single local pharmacy -- that's more than 30,000 pills per resident. The companies shipping these pills repeatedly disregarded requirements to report suspicious patterns of behavior, and the state Board of Pharmacy failed to enforce its own rules. Now, Kermit is fighting back with a lawsuit against the pharmacy and five wholesale drug distributors that exacerbated the crisis. It's just one of many similar lawsuits lodged by towns, counties, and states across the country -- and I hope they win. But the fact that any of this happened in the first place speaks to something rotten in our system. Here's the truth: big business is fueling addiction. The five companies that Kermit is suing earned $17 billion shipping prescription opioids to West Virginia during the period in question, and their CEOs took home millions in bonuses and pay. This crisis has been driven by greed, pure and simple. Just look at the Sackler family. They own a pharmaceutical empire. They're billionaires. They own mansions around the world. Entire wings of museums in New York and London have been stamped with the family name. But here's the thing: the Sacklers made their money pushing OxyContin. Pushing it even as study after study demonstrated its addictive potential. Even as hundreds of thousands of Americans died. And how did the Sackler family react? They tried to increase their profits by opening a network of for-profit recovery centers to treat the very same health crisis they were fueling. The opioid epidemic teaches us that too often in America today, if you have money and power, you can take advantage of everyone else without consequence. I think it's time to change that. Under my opioid plan, billionaires like the Sacklers wouldn't get to live the high life while only 1 out of 5 folks who need opioid treatment get the help they need. Instead, they would pay up to help make sure every person gets the care they need. And under my Corporate Executive Accountability Act, executives of major companies that deliberately hurt people through criminal negligence -- for example, by dumping mountains of highly addictive pills into towns like Kermit to make a quick buck -- don't just pay a fine, they face real criminal penalties. Real, structural change to address this crisis is going to take new leadership in Washington. Leadership that will hold business executives that cheat and defraud and addict people responsible for their criminal acts. Leadership that requires folks like the Sacklers and their heirs to pay a bit more to clean up the mess they caused. That's the America we deserve. An America where we take care of each other, where health care for every person who needs it matters more than rich families shielding their wealth. An America where when people like the Sacklers destroy millions of lives to make money, they don't get museum wings named after them, they go to jail. If you're with me in this fight to end the opioid epidemic and make sure a crisis like this never happens again, add your name here: ++HYPERLINK++ Thanks for being a part of this, Elizabeth SIGN THE PETITION: ++HYPERLINK++ Paid for by Warren for President ____________________________________________ All content 2019 Warren for President, All Rights Reserved PO Box 171375, Boston, MA 02116 ____________________________________________ This email was sent to TestBro1745@gmail.com.

Some say if we all just calm down, the Republicans will come to their senses. But our country is in a time of crisis. The time for small ideas is over. Big problems call for big solutions. If we are going to save our democracy, build an economy that works for everyone, and clean up the corruption in Washington, we need big, structural changes. And yes, I have a plan for that.

Can you chip in right now to say you're in this fight all the way? ++HYPERLINK++ When I'm president, we will... - Pass the biggest anti-corruption plan since Watergate - Break up big ag, big banks, and big tech - Make it easier for workers to join a union - Pass a wealth tax, and use a big hunk of that money for Universal Child care and early education, free public college, at least $50 billion in a fund for Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and cancelling student loan debt for 95% of people carrying it When I lead the Democratic Party, we will not be a party that nibbles around the edges. Our Democratic Party will be a party of bold, structural change. But bold, structural change doesn't happen on its own. We dream big and we fight hard. Because the rich and powerful aren't giving up anything without a fight. Millions of grassroots Democrats are ready to fight -- in your area and across the country. But when it gets hard, when there's a lot on the line, too many powerful people in our party say settle down, back up, there's nothing to be angry about. Here's the thing: When a candidate tells you about all the things that aren't possible, about how political calculations come first, about how you should settle for little bits and pieces instead of real change, they're telling you something very important: they are telling you that they will not fight for you. Not me. I'm here to fight. When I lead the Democratic Party, we will be a party of moral clarity, a party of courage, and a party with backbone. So if you're like me and think we need to be a party of big plans to make this country work for everyone -- a party that has the courage to fight for those plans -- then join me.

It's clear: People are hungry for big, structural change. And Elizabeth has a plan to make it happen. After the event, Elizabeth stayed for three hours to talk with supporters and take a selfie with anyone who wanted one. And on Saturday, Elizabeth fired up the crowd at the California Democratic Party Convention: \"Here's the thing: when a candidate tells you about all the things that aren't possible, about how political calculations come first, about how you should settle for little bits and pieces instead of real change, they're telling you something very important: They are telling you that they will not fight for you.\" \"Not me. I'm here to fight.\" If you're in this fight all the way too, own a piece of this campaign by making a contribution for the first time. ++HYPERLINK++ Thanks for everything, Team Warren P.S. Usually, when presidential candidates go to California, it's just for a spree of fancy private fundraisers. But Elizabeth doesn't do those. Her time is not for sale -- she spends all her time talking with as many supporters as possible. That means it's only grassroots donors powering this campaign. Can you chip in now?

        "Body": "I'll just be blunt: I'm about to ask if you can make a donation to our campaign. But first, can you give me a minute to explain why it would make a real difference toward helping hit our end-of-quarter fundraising goal by midnight tonight? Here's the way I see it: Our campaign is based on big ideas and a core principle -- everyone gets equal access because we're fighting for a government that works for everyone. Our democracy is not for sale, and neither is my time. So I've opted out of the unwritten rule of politics that says I'm supposed to run for office by sucking up to rich donors on Wall Street and powerful interests in Washington. I'm not hosting swanky fundraisers where you can only get in if you write a ginormous check. I'm not taking PAC money, donations from federal lobbyists, or applications from billionaires who want to run a Super PAC on my behalf. If we keep letting big money control our campaigns, the wealthy and well-connected will keep controlling Washington. And our government will keep working just for people who can afford to hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers. We're fighting to change all that. We're building a grassroots movement to put power in the hands of the people. And it's only possible with contributions from people like you. I'm grateful from the bottom of my heart that you're on our team. Will you make a donation right now to help make sure we hit our goal? We're a little behind right now, but we can make it happen with a big push before midnight tonight. ++HYPERLINK++ When we hit our fundraising goals -- dollar by dollar, quarter after quarter -- and keep building our movement -- face to face, person to person -- we show the rich and the powerful that change is coming. Sooner than they think. Billionaires, CEOs, big banks, and giant corporations won't always run the show in Washington. I've got a plan -- a bunch of plans -- to level the playing field for working people and make sure we're building a future not just for some of our kids, but all of our kids. If the rich and powerful don't like it, then tough. We've got to make big, structural change. We're going to. But it'll take a massive grassroots movement to get it done. But first, our next big test is the fundraising deadline tonight at midnight, and we need all hands on deck to hit our goal. If you can, please chip in.

        "Body": "If you work hard and have a good idea, you should be able to start a small business and build something solid for you and your family. But let's face it: Not every entrepreneur starts out with an equal chance at success. Decades of government policy helped create a racial wealth gap. That means the playing field is tilted against entrepreneurs of color -- they don't have as much money to put into their businesses to get them going. Just look at this stat: On average, Black entrepreneurs start a business with $35,000 in capital. That's a third of the startup capital for the typical white entrepreneur. If everyone started off on the same footing, we'd have more small businesses opening their doors -- and keeping them open -- across the country, creating millions of new jobs and billions of dollars of economic growth. That's why I have a new plan: a Small Business Equity Fund to help close the startup capital gap for entrepreneurs of color. But we can only get it done if we build a grassroots movement for it. Add your name to support our new plan. ++HYPERLINK++ Because this new plan is part of our economic patriotism agenda -- to use all the tools of government to defend and create good American jobs -- this new program will be run by the new Department of Economic Development. We'll provide entrepreneurs with $7 billion of grants -- no strings attached that would leave businesses with debt when they're trying to grow. Why $7 billion? That's enough to ensure that if Black, Latinx, and Native American entrepreneurs start businesses at the same rate as white entrepreneurs, we could fully close the startup capital gap for the next ten years -- supporting over 100,000 new businesses and 1.1 million new jobs. But we also need to tackle more of the systemic issues tilting the playing field against entrepreneurs of color. Eighty-six percent of venture capitalists are white, and studies show that investors are more likely to partner with entrepreneurs who look like them. So I'll direct all federal pension and retirement funds to seek out a more diverse set of investment managers, require states and cities administering the new Fund to work with diverse investment managers, and triple the budget of the Minority Business Development Agency. Wondering how we'll pay for all this? I've got a plan for that: It's fully covered by the Ultra-Millionaire Tax, which is just two cents on every dollar of wealth above $50 million. Our new plan embraces the fundamental truth that we can never achieve racial justice without economic justice. Government helped create the entrepreneurship gap, and government has an obligation to help solve it -- with bold policies that tackle the problem head on. Everyone deserves the opportunity to fight for the American dream -- to build something real and build a brighter future for themselves and their loved ones. Add your name if you agree. We've all got to be in this fight, side by side in a grassroots movement, to make government work for everyone -- not just the rich and powerful. ++HYPERLINK++ Thanks for being a part of this, Elizabeth ADD YOUR NAME: ++HYPERLINK++ Elizabeth doesn't accept contributions from PACs of any kind or federally registered lobbyists.

        "Body": "It's clear: Our election system is under attack. So is the right to vote. I've got a new plan to fight back. We can make voting in America easy, efficient, and secure from foreign and domestic threats -- but we can only make it happen if we fight side by side. Can you add your name today to join our grassroots movement for protecting and strengthening our democracy? ++HYPERLINK++ Voting should be easy. But instead, many states make it hard for people to vote. We have all heard stories about polling places running out of ballots, computer problems causing delays, and extremely long lines preventing working families from voting. It's a messy and inefficient system thoroughly unsuited to the greatest democracy in the world. And on top of these administrative issues, racist and partisan officials deliberately seek to stop citizens -- especially communities of color -- from exercising the right to vote. We need a constitutional amendment that guarantees the right to vote and to have that vote counted, but we also need to take action now. Here's my plan: 1. Federal elections will have state-of-the-art federal machines, federal ballots, and federal security. Right now, districts all over the country use dated machines that are easily hackable and have no paper trail. No more. The federal government will replace every voting machine in the country with state-of-the-art equipment and mandate a single uniform federal ballot. And we will lock all federal voting technology systems behind a security firewall like it's Fort Knox. 2. Federal standards for federal elections. We have 8,000 election jurisdictions across the country running elections with little to no federal standards -- and errors are everywhere. No more. We will have federal standards to ensure everyone is able to vote, including mandating automatic and same-day registration, early voting, and vote by mail. My plan will give states cutting-edge voting equipment and election security protocols, all paid for by the federal government, and states will be required to follow all federal standards for federal elections. States who also choose to meet these requirements in their state elections can work through federal-state partnership agreements to have those elections fully funded by the federal government, too -- and we'll give them a bonus for achieving high voter turnout rates. And in areas where politicians refuse to follow the law and disenfranchise voters, the federal government will take action to guarantee that every American has the fundamental right to vote. 3. We will eliminate voter suppression and make sure every American is able to cast their vote. My plan will mean no more arbitrary voter purges. States will be banned from removing voters from the election rolls unless the voter requests to be removed. We will make Election Day a national holiday, and all federal elections will have a minimum of 15 days of early voting, expanded voting hours, the option to vote with a sworn statement of identity instead of an ID, convenient polling locations, and voting by mail. We will make sure that those who have served their time in prison and paid their debt to society are able to vote. And we will pass the Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Native American Voting Rights Act to shut down discriminatory practices that have gone on for too long. Enough is enough. It's time to make voting in the greatest democracy in the world easy, convenient, and accessible. It's time to secure our elections from all threats, foreign and domestic, and make sure that every American is able to have their vote counted. And we can get it done. Together, we can fight for the integrity of our election system.

        "From": "Elizabeth Warren <info@elizabethwarren.com>",
        "Body": "I wish I could call my daddy today. After my mother died, I called him every night. Most weekends, we watched sports together, with Daddy in Oklahoma and me in Massachusetts, and we called back and forth on the phone after a really good (or bad) play. I wanted to keep him company, and I wanted to hear his voice. In the 1920s, my daddy had big dreams. He wanted to fly airplanes. He was barely out of high school when he rebuilt a two-passenger, open-cockpit airplane and taught himself to fly above the prairies of eastern Oklahoma. I always pictured him landing and taking off in vast wheat fields, a tiny plane in an immense blue sky. He survived the double blows of the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression in the small town where he grew up. Decades later, both my parents still talked of bank failures and families who lost their farms during some of the toughest times for our country. By the time World War II came along, my mother and daddy already had three young boys. Daddy tried to enlist to be a fighter pilot in the war, but the Army Air Forces (as it was known then) said he was too old, or at least that's the explanation I heard. When the war finally ended, Daddy desperately wanted a job flying the new passenger planes for one of the fast-growing airlines like TWA or American. But that didn't work out either. My mother told me that those jobs also went to younger men. So Daddy moved from one job to another: He was a salesman, he fixed cars, he was a janitor. He liked working with his hands, doing repairs around the house. And like a zillion other families, we got by. When I was a senior in high school, I started thinking about college. I wanted to be a teacher, and that meant I needed a college diploma. But my mother said it was out of the question. She pointed out that we couldn't afford college, that she and Daddy just didn't make enough money. Besides, my daddy had had a heart attack, and now it took both of my parents' paychecks to manage. I knew how much my parents sacrificed for my future and for my brothers' future, but I wanted to teach. It was my dream, and I wouldn't give up. My mother kept saying no, and we argued back and forth. Then Daddy surprised both of us, saying: \"Let her try, Polly.\" And I was off and running. There were lots of bumps and wrong turns along the way. I got married at 19 (it didn't work out). I moved. I dropped out of school. But eventually, I made it. Whatever I did, my daddy believed in me. He would say, \"That's my Betsy.\" In truth, I think he found it pretty miraculous that his baby girl had ended up a teacher. He nearly busted his buttons the first time I was quoted in the newspaper. When my daddy got sick, I came across a video series about the airplanes of World War II. I bought all the videotapes and took them to him. I was sure he would love seeing the old planes, that he would point out this or that plane he remembered from the war. But the only thing he wanted to talk about was how much he missed my mother. For months -- for years, actually -- after he died, I would see or hear something and think, Oh, I'll tell Daddy about that. And then I'd get a little jolt all over again. I would not be here had it not been for my daddy pushing open a door so that I could have a chance. That is how this daughter of a janitor ended up as a public school teacher, a college professor, a U.S. senator, and a candidate for president of the United States. And I'm not the only one. Parents all across our country are working hard to give their children the opportunities they themselves never had. That kind of sacrifice -- a sacrifice fueled by love -- is why I'm in this fight all the way. All of our children deserve a chance to succeed. And all of our parents deserve the peace of mind knowing their hard work created a better future for their children and grandchildren. That is the promise of America, and I'm fighting to make sure we keep that promise. My daddy is gone, but I want to wish him a Happy Father's Day. And Happy Father's Day to all the daddies who are trying their hardest to give their children a strong future -- and who set the example every day of what it means to care for the people you love. Happy Father's Day!

        "From": "Elizabeth Warren <info@elizabethwarren.com>",
        "Body": "In Alabama, Missouri, and in states across the country, extremist Republican lawmakers are trying to turn back the clock, outlaw abortion, and deny women access to reproductive health care. Even though Roe v. Wade established a woman's constitutional right to a safe and legal abortion -- and has been the law of the land for over 46 years -- these extremist Republican lawmakers don't care. And they are hoping the Supreme Court will back their radical play. And it just might work. Donald Trump has packed the courts with extreme, anti-choice judges. Senate Republicans stole a Supreme Court seat and rammed through the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh last year to cement an anti-choice majority on the Supreme Court. This is a dark moment. People are scared and angry. And they are right to be. But this isn't a moment to back down -- it's time to fight back. And I've got a plan. Congress should pass new federal laws that protect access to reproductive care from right-wing ideologues in the states. Federal laws that ensure real access to birth control and abortion care for all women. Federal laws that will stand no matter what the Supreme Court does. Add your name if you agree, and let's fight to get this done. ++HYPERLINK++ Here's what our plan looks like: 1. Create federal, statutory rights that parallel the constitutional right in Roe v. Wade. These rights would have at least two key components. First, they must prohibit states from interfering in the ability of a health care provider to provide medical care, including abortion services. Second, they must prohibit states from interfering in the ability of a patient to access medical care, including abortion services, from a provider that offers them. Federal law preempts state law, so as soon as Congress takes this step, we'd sweep away the bans in Alabama, Georgia, Ohio, and anywhere else. We'd end the political games being played by right-wing courts to try to narrow Roe's protections. And because these federal protections would be valid on a variety of constitutional grounds, they would ensure that choice would remain the law of the land even if the Supreme Court overturns Roe. 2. Pass federal laws to preempt state efforts that functionally limit access to reproductive health care. States have passed countless \"TRAP\" laws -- laws that circumvent Roe to functionally limit and eliminate women's access to abortion care -- which are are medically unnecessary and exist for only one purpose: to functionally eliminate the ability of women to access abortion services. A bill already proposed in Congress, The Women's Health Protection Act, could help block these kinds of schemes concocted to deny women access to care. Congress should pass it. 3. Guarantee reproductive health coverage as part of all health coverage. All women -- no matter where they live, where they're from, how much money they make, or the color of their skin -- are entitled to access the high-quality, evidence-based reproductive health care that is envisioned by Roe. Making that a reality starts with repealing the Hyde Amendment, which blocks abortion coverage for women under federally funded health care programs like Medicaid, the VA, and the Indian Health Service. Congress should also expand culturally and linguistically appropriate services and information and include immigrant women in conversations about coverage and access. Congress must also pass the EACH Woman Act, which would also prohibit abortion restrictions on private insurance. And we should ensure that all future health coverage -- including Medicare for All -- includes contraception and abortion coverage. Ensure equal access and reproductive justice. We must undo the current administration's efforts to undermine women's access to reproductive health care -- including ending Trump's gag rule -- and fully support Title X family planning funding. We must crack down on violence at abortion clinics and ensure that women are not discriminated against at work or anywhere else for the choices they made about their bodies. And these issues are bigger than Roe. The women of color who have championed the reproductive justice movement teach us that we must go beyond choice to ensure meaningful access for every woman in America -- not just the privileged and wealthy few. We must go beyond abortion, to ensure access to contraception, STI prevention and care, comprehensive sex education, care for pregnant moms, safe home and work environments, adequate wages, and so much more. We must build a future that protects the right of all women to have children, the right of all women to not have children, and the right to bring children up in a safe and healthy environment. The overwhelming majority of Americans have no desire to return to the world before Roe v. Wade. And so the time to act is now. It's inspiring to see so many women coming off the sidelines in this fight -- and women must continue to speak up to make sure this conversation stays grounded in their real experiences. Men must speak up too. And Americans outraged by these efforts should get into the political arena, run for office, and make these right-wing Republican lawmakers face the consequences of their actions. We're going through a tough time. A really tough time. But we're not helpless. We're strong. We've got power in our democracy. So let's use it. Our democracy should not be held hostage by right-wing courts, and women should not have to hope that Brett Kavanaugh and Donald Trump's Supreme Court will respect the law. Add your name if you agree Congress should act to ensure access to reproductive care -- including real access to birth control and abortion. ++HYPERLINK++ Thanks for being a part of this, Elizabeth SIGN THE PETITION: ++HYPERLINK++ Paid for by Warren for President ____________________________________________ All content 2019 Warren for President, All Rights Reserved PO Box 171375, Boston, MA 02116 ____________________________________________ This email was sent to TestBro1745@gmail.com.

        "Body": "There's only one way we're raising money for this campaign. I'm not holding any fundraisers where you can only get in by writing a big check -- because a person's wealth shouldn't determine the amount of time they can spend with me or any presidential candidate. I'm not counting on a billionaire to fund a Super PAC for me -- because the Democratic primary can't just be one more plaything for the rich and powerful. I'm not taking a dime from federally registered lobbyists, corporate PACs, or PACs of any kind -- because our campaign is about people, not powerful special interests. Instead, we're building a true grassroots campaign with grassroots donors -- because that's the only way we'll create a movement strong enough to make big, structural change in our economy, our government, and our democracy. I wouldn't ask if it weren't powerfully important: Today is the last day to reach our May fundraising goal. So will you make your first donation to our campaign? $3 or whatever you can chip in would make a huge difference. We can't do this without you. ++HYPERLINK++ On a typical presidential campaign, during the last few days of the month, I'd fly from big city to big city to scoop up as many big fat checks as possible. We'd be trying to squeeze every last dollar out of bigwig donors to help hit our monthly fundraising goal. They might come see me at a fancy reception in hedge fund offices or in a backyard of a huge mansion. They'd sip champagne, nibble on some food, and try to convince me that the tax loophole that just so happens to pad their pockets is also good for the whole country. But I'm not running to be a president who only pays attention to the wealthy and well-connected. I'm running to be everybody's president. My time is not for sale, and every supporter has an equal place in our movement. If you ask me, that's what a campaign for president should be all about. Talking with people across the country, in their hometowns, about real solutions to real problems. And getting organized at the grassroots level to make change happen. But this type of campaign is only possible if everyone who is able pitches in what they can. I'm running to be the best president that money can't buy, but I can't do it alone.

Democrats win when we go out there and fight for the big, structural change we need -- to make our government and our economy work for working people. I'm not afraid to fight for this. And for Democrats to win, you can't be afraid either. I took on the big banks, and I beat them. I took on Wall Street CEOs, and I beat them. I took on a popular incumbent senator, and I beat him. I will beat Donald Trump in 2020, but I won't do it alone. Side by side, we'll build a movement, we'll fight, and we'll win. And then we'll make big, structural change in 2021 and beyond.

        "Body": "Everywhere I go, I talk about how we need to make big, structural change -- to solve the deep, systemic problems we face as a country. I've seen it work before. Take the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. We had a plan, we got organized, and we turned it into a reality. The story starts one morning in the 1970s, when I forgot about a few pieces of bread I'd left in the toaster oven -- and nearly set my kitchen on fire. Back then, our toaster oven had an on-off switch and that was it. At some point, someone had the bright idea of adding a timer and automatic shut-off. This simple change made it a whole lot harder for distracted mothers, or anyone else, to leave it running until it set the kitchen on fire. Thirty years later, while working on an article about how the government could protect consumers from predatory financial companies, I thought about those old toaster ovens. By then, it was all but impossible to buy a toaster that had a one-in-five chance of bursting into flames and burning down your house. A government agency monitored toasters for basic safety, just like government kept lead paint out of children's toys and rat poison out of medicine. But it was possible to refinance a home with a mortgage that had a one-in-five chance of costing a family their home and putting them out on the street. In fact, it wasn't just possible: Those mortgages were bursting into flames all over the country. I had a plan for how we could change the rules with a structural fix: A new government agency whose sole mission was to look out for consumers. They could serve as the cop on the beat and could make sure that financial companies followed some clear, commonsense rules. No tricks hidden in the fine print, no traps buried in complex legalese. I wrote my article calling for a new \"Financial Product Safety Commission,\" and I started it by calling out the difference between exploding toasters and exploding mortgages. After the financial crisis, the plan didn't seem so pie-in-the-sky. So we got organized. Labor unions like the AFL-CIO and SEIU joined our fight to protect working people. Civil rights organizations like the NAACP and National Council for La Raza jumped in (African American and Latino families had been targeted with some of the very worst subprime mortgages). And groups like the AARP and Consumers Union said this was their fight, too. Of course, the giant financial institutions were dead set against an agency whose job was to get the tricks and traps out of the fine print of financial products. They spent millions lobbying against financial reform and the new consumer agency. It was David-versus-Goliath all the way -- but in 2010, President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Act into law. Exactly one year later, the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was open for business. And in the nearly eight years since it's been created, this little agency has forced big financial institutions to return $12 billion directly to people who were cheated. We've done it before, and we can do it again. We'll keep making plans, we'll keep getting organized, and we'll make big, structural change to get Washington working for working people -- not just for the rich and powerful. But no one makes it happen on their own. It takes a grassroots movement -- you and me working together, and fighting side by side with people all over the country. If you're ready to keep making change happen, will you support our campaign with a contribution of $3 or whatever you can afford today? ++HYPERLINK++ Thanks for being a part of this, Elizabeth DONATE NOW: ++HYPERLINK++ Paid for by Warren for President ____________________________________________ All content 2019 Warren for President, All Rights Reserved PO Box 171375, Boston, MA 02116 ____________________________________________ This email was sent to TestBro1745@gmail.com.

And what do you need to do to get inside and have special access to a presidential candidate? Write a big, big, check. (Tip: the more zeroes, the better.) You won't see that on this campaign.

That's because if we want to make big, structural change in this country, we need to spend time talking face to face with people all across the country to grow a movement big enough to win. Here's the catch: Campaigns are expensive. By swearing off private fundraisers with wealthy donors, we're leaving money on the table. But this is the campaign we want to run. Are you in?

        "Date": "Sun, 19 May 2019 19:41:20 +0000",
        "From": "Elizabeth Warren <info@elizabethwarren.com>",
        "Body": "Let me tell you why I went to Northern Virginia last week. I hosted a town hall not too far away from the Pentagon -- and not too far away from the big, shiny offices of the biggest defense contractors. It's no surprise that these companies have clustered around the Pentagon, sometimes within walking distance. At our town hall, we talked about a real problem: Too many of our defense contractors don't just want a seat at the table. They want to own the table. Coziness between defense lobbyists, Congress, and the Pentagon -- what Dwight D. Eisenhower called the military-industrial complex -- tilts countless decisions, big and small, away from legitimate national security interests and toward the desires of giant corporations that thrive off taxpayer dollars. I've got a plan to fix it: My new Department of Defense Ethics and Anti-Corruption Act. It would shut the revolving door between giant contractors and the Pentagon, ban DoD officials from owning contractor stock, limit foreign government hiring of American national security officials, and expose defense contractor lobbying. Add your name to become a citizen co-sponsor. Help show Washington that there's a grassroots movement ready to fight against corruption. SIGN THE PETITION: ++HYPERLINK++ Defense contractor influence is a big part of how we ended up with a Pentagon budget that'll cost more this year than we'll spend on education, medical research, housing, disaster relief -- everything else in the discretionary budget put together. It's past time to cut our bloated defense budget and address a big hunk of the root cause: corruption. Here's my plan to fight back: 1. Slam Shut the Revolving Door Between Giant Contractors and the Pentagon. My plan would ban giant defense contractors from hiring senior DoD officials and generals and flag officers for four years after they leave the Department. It would also require contractors to identify the former DoD officials who work for them and what they're working on. To fully eliminate the opportunity for conflicts of interest, a former employee or executive of a defense contractor who joins the government would be totally banned from working on anything that could influence their former bosses. 2. Ban DoD Officials from Owning Contractor Stock. This one is a no-brainer. My plan would ban all senior DoD officials from owning or trading any stock of giant defense contractors. And it would ban all DoD employees from owning or trading stock if they're in a position to influence that contractor's bottom line. 3. Limit Foreign Government Hiring of American National Security Officials. Former senior national security officials shouldn't get paid big bucks to work for foreign governments -- especially when that work undermines U.S. interests. My plan would make it illegal. 4. Expose Defense Contractor Lobbying. Defense contractors should be required to disclose the true scope of their lobbying activities -- including who they're meeting with at the DoD, what they're lobbying about, and what (unclassified) information they're sharing. And federal open records laws should apply to private defense contractors so the public can understand what they're doing. this fight is personal for me. All three of my brothers went off to join the military because, like tens of thousands of uniformed and civilian employees and officers at the Defense Department, they wanted to serve their country. We should all be grateful for that kind of service and sacrifice. You know how we can demonstrate that gratitude? Let's make sure that national security decisions are driven only by what best keeps Americans safe. Not by private profits. Not by foreign interests. I'll keep fighting to crack down on corruption in every corner of Washington, but I can't do it alone. Will you add your name to become a citizen co-sponsor of our new Department of Defense Ethics and Anti-Corruption Act?

        "From": "Elizabeth Warren <info@elizabethwarren.com>",
        "Body": "When a criminal on the street steals money from your wallet, they go to jail. When small business owners cheat their customers, they go to jail. But when corporate executives at big companies oversee frauds that hurt tens of thousands of people, they often get to walk away with multi-million dollar payouts. Just look at all the scams that Wells Fargo pulled in recent years: opening unauthorized bank accounts, cheating customers on mortgages and car loans, mistreating service-members -- and the legal consequences that their CEOs haven't faced. In 2016, after the Wells Fargo fake accounts scam came to light, I called out then-CEO John Stumpf for gutlessly throwing workers at the bank under the bus -- and told him he should resign. Weeks later, he did. When Wells Fargo elevated longtime senior executive Tim Sloan to replace Stumpf, I told Sloan he should be fired for his role in enabling and covering up the fake accounts scam. For years, I pressured federal regulators, urging Sloan's dismissal, and last week Sloan \"retired.\" I'm glad Stumpf and Sloan got canned. But this isn't real accountability. It's time to reform our laws to make sure that corporate executives face jail time for overseeing massive scams. My Ending Too Big To Jail Act would make it easier to hold financial executives accountable for scams that take place at the companies they manage. And I'm announcing a new proposal to expand criminal liability to any corporate executive who negligently oversees a giant company causing severe harm to American families. Sign our petition to become an official citizen co-sponsor. ++HYPERLINK++ Our Too Big To Jail Act would require executives at big banks to certify that they conducted a \"due diligence\" inquiry and found that no illegal conduct was occurring on their watch. This would force executives to look for wrongdoing or face prosecution for filing false certifications with the government. And it would create a permanent and well-funded unit dedicated to investigating financial crimes. And our new proposal would impose criminal liability for negligent executives of big companies in a variety of circumstances -- including if the company is found guilty of a crime or is found liable for a civil violation affecting the health, safety, finances, or personal data of huge numbers of Americans. If top executives knew that they would be hauled out in handcuffs for failing to reasonably oversee the companies they run, they would have a real incentive to better monitor their operations and snuff out any wrongdoing before it gets out of hand. Remember: It's been 10 years since the financial crisis cost millions of people their homes, their jobs, and their savings, and not one major bank executive has gone to jail -- or even been prosecuted. Tens of thousands of Americans have died from overdosing on commonly prescribed opioids, but not a single major pharmaceutical executive has gone to prison for their role in this tragedy. Four words are engraved over the front door of the Supreme Court: Equal Justice Under Law. It's the fundamental principle that's supposed to drive our legal system. But it's not equal justice when a kid with an ounce of pot can get thrown in jail while a wealthy executive can walk away with a bonus after his company cheats millions of people. Corporate America needs a wake-up call, and the rest of us need a justice system that ensures that if you cheat and steal and defraud and hurt Americans, you could go to jail. Personal accountability is the only way to ensure that executives at corporations will think twice before ignoring the law. It's time to stop making excuses and start making real change. Add your name if you agree: ++HYPERLINK++ Thanks for being a part of this, Elizabeth SIGN THE PETITION: ++HYPERLINK++ Every supporter who makes a donation owns an equal piece of our campaign, regardless of how much you can give.

No wealthy donor fundraisers, no PACs, no federal lobbyists. - Elizabeth takes a photo with everyone who wants one after her town halls -- and she gets to hear people's stories, face to face. Fun fact: She's now taken over 35,000 of those photos since this campaign started! - Her Ultra-Millionaire Tax -- on households worth $50 million or more -- will fully pay for Universal Child Care, her student loan debt cancelation plan, universal free public college, and more. - Speaking of student loan debt, you can calculate how much of your debt would be canceled under Elizabeth's plan right on her website. ++HYPERLINK++ - Same with child care -- you can find out how much your family would save! ++HYPERLINK++ - She's got a dog named Bailey and a husband named Bruce. - She knows how the American economy is stacked against working families, and that's why she went to Washington to lead the fight to create the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has already put $12 billion directly in the pockets of people who were cheated by financial institutions. - She's committed to fighting for big structural change, and she'll fight as hard for you as for her own family.

        "Body": "The next FEC fundraising deadline is just six days away. On a typical campaign right now, the candidate would be sprinting from big city to big city and from swanky fundraiser to swanky fundraiser. They'd spend their time scooping up big checks from wealthy donors behind closed doors. But that's not Elizabeth's style. This week, she'll host public town halls to take questions from voters in Miami and Chicago (before and after she's in Wednesday night's Democratic presidential primary debate). Elizabeth has time to run a truly grassroots campaign because she doesn't stuff her schedule with any exclusive fundraising events for big donors. But we still need to raise the money from somewhere, and we're counting on grassroots donors to step up and own a piece of this campaign. Will you chip in before Sunday's huge fundraising deadline? ++HYPERLINK++ You'll help make it possible for Elizabeth to keep laying out bold new plans to make our economy and our government work for everyone -- not just the rich and powerful. >From ensuring Universal Child Care to canceling student loan debt to solving the affordable housing crisis, Elizabeth has a plan for it. And Elizabeth's plans are informed by the conversations she has on the campaign trail. She wouldn't have time for all of those conversations if she devoted most of her schedule to chatting up big donors. She gets to talk with people about the real issues in their lives -- like how much student debt they have, the cost of their prescription drugs, or how hard it is to find an affordable place to live. People's personal stories fire her up to keep making more and more plans for big, structural change. We can make Elizabeth's plans a reality. We can live in an America where Washington works for working people. But first, we need to build the biggest possible grassroots movement -- and that comes down to hitting every single fundraising goal before every single deadline. Make your first contribution before Sunday's deadline, and you'll make a real difference in this fight. ++HYPERLINK++ Thanks, Team Warren DONATE NOW: ++HYPERLINK++ Paid for by Warren for President ____________________________________________ All content 2019 Warren for President, All Rights Reserved PO Box 171375, Boston, MA 02116 ____________________________________________ This email was sent to TestBro1745@gmail.com.

        "Body": "Yesterday, we woke up to the second mass shooting in just as many days. I'm heartbroken for El Paso and Dayton, and to all the families who have just endured unimaginable loss. We need commonsense gun reform -- now, before the next mass shooting, to stop the daily gun violence on our streets, and to make sure that our families and loved ones are safe. But Mitch McConnell and Republicans in the Senate are blocking legislation that could help address this epidemic. During the last election, we flipped the House. And in February, the Democratic-led House passed bipartisan legislation that would make a meaningful impact on this crisis. But five months after passing the House, and more than six and a half years after Sandy Hook, that bill is still sitting on Mitch McConnell's desk. It's inexcusable. It's clear Republicans don't have the courage to do something about this crisis. We can't wait for them to act -- because they won't. If we're going to address the gun violence epidemic in our country, we need to take back the Senate in 2020. I'll fight my heart out to make sure Democrats win up and down the ballot in 2020 -- but if we're going to beat Republicans and the gun lobby, it's going to take a grassroots movement. Will you chip in today to help Democrats flip the Senate? Your donation will be split among funds that will go to the eventual Democratic Senate nominees in 23 races and Senators Doug Jones and Tina Smith. If you've saved payment info with ActBlue Express, your donation will process automatically and be evenly split to support the eventual Democratic nominee for Senate in AK, AR, AZ, CO, GA, IA, ID, KS, KY, LA, ME, MS, MT, NC, NE, NM, OK, SC, SD, TN, TX, WV, WY, and Doug Jones and Tina Smith: ++HYPERLINK++ As long as Mitch McConnell-led Senate Republicans are in power, they will stonewall and block any attempts for change. That's because they answer to the gun lobbyists who sign their checks -- no matter how many innocent people die each and every day at the hands of their inaction. Enough is enough. We must call out what happened in El Paso and Dayton for what they are: domestic terrorism. It's a threat to the United States, and we've seen its devastating toll this weekend. We need to call out the president himself for advancing racism and white supremacy. And then we need to take action. It's powerfully important that we support Democrats across the country and take back the Senate in 2020 -- so we can take power back from Republicans, fight back against the gun lobby, and address the gun violence epidemic head on. So I'm asking you to join me in supporting our Democratic Senate candidates in states across the country. Can you chip in today to help Democrats flip the Senate in 2020?

We'll start with a new federal agency with one mission: Defend and create American jobs. It's time to make fundamental, structural changes in how government treats the economy. When I'm president, that's exactly what we'll do. Add your name to say you're a part of this fight. ++HYPERLINK++ We'll put American workers and middle-class prosperity ahead of multinational profits and Wall Street bonuses. And we'll reject the excuses we've heard for decades about why we can't do more to help workers. The truth is that Washington policies -- not unstoppable market forces -- are a key driver of the problems American workers face. >From our trade agreements to our tax code, we've encouraged companies to invest abroad, ship jobs overseas, and keep wages low. All in the interest of serving multinational companies and international capital with no particular loyalty to the United States. In my administration, we'll stop making excuses. We'll pursue aggressive new government policies to support American workers. Our new Department of Economic Development will replace the Commerce Department and a handful of other federal agencies. Right now, government programs that affect job creation are an afterthought, uncoordinated and scattered across the government, and submerged in larger agencies with different primary missions. Let's pull them together and use aggressive new tools -- that other countries have used successfully -- to fight for American workers. Critically, all of our trade-related programs will fall within the new Department. That way, we'll make clear that trade policy must defend and create American jobs. This is not a question of more or less government: It's about who the government works for. In the weeks ahead, I'll release more plans on how this vision of economic patriotism should shape our economy, from trade policy to Wall Street -- and I'll keep you posted. Add your name if you're on board: We need to make American workers our highest priority, rather than continuing to cater to the interests of companies and people with no allegiance to America. ++HYPERLINK++ Thanks for being a part of this, Elizabeth ADD YOUR NAME: ++HYPERLINK++ Elizabeth doesn't accept contributions from PACs of any kind or federally registered lobbyists.

        "Body": "I'm thinking about my mother today. I was just a kid when my daddy had a heart attack. It was serious -- we weren't sure if he was going to make it. He eventually got better, but he was out of work for a long time. We lost our family station wagon. It looked like the house would be next to go. At night, I'd overhear my parents talk, and that's when I learned words like \"mortgage\" and \"foreclosure.\" I remember one morning, I was standing in my mother's bedroom on a warm spring day. Her face was red and puffy, and about a dozen wadded-up tissues were on the bedspread next to a black dress. It was that one dress that every mom had -- the one that only came out for weddings, funerals, and graduations. And she was saying, \"We will not lose this house. We will not lose this house.\" She was 50 years old. She had never worked outside the home. She was terrified. I watched her while she pulled it together, put that dress on, put on her high heels, blew her nose, walked to Sears, and got a minimum wage job. And that minimum wage job saved our house, but more importantly, it saved our family. That story is who I am. That story is written on my heart. And for a long time, I used to think that was just a story about my mother. But years later, I came to understand that it's a story about millions of Americans who -- no matter how scared they are -- reach down, dig deep, find it, and pull up what they need to take care of the family. And then years later I came to understand this: It's also a story about government. Because when this happened to my family, a minimum wage job in America could support a family of three. It could take care of a mortgage, utilities, and put food on the table. But today in America, a full-time minimum wage job will not keep a mama and a baby out of poverty. So let's be honest: My mother's story isn't possible today. Right now, when people in government are deciding what the minimum wage should be, they're not trying to figure out what it takes to support a family -- to make it possible for people to get a little toe in the door. No. I hear them in Washington. They ask, \"What will improve the profitability of giant corporations?\" I want a government that doesn't just work for giant corporations. I want one that works for little families like mine. My mother didn't have much, but she knew that her four kids had a fighting chance to build a future -- and that made her life successful. Today, where mothers and families end up in life is about more than hard work and good fortune. The rules for a level playing field matter, too. That's what I'm fighting for to honor my mother, on Mother's Day and every day. Thank you for being in this fight alongside me. Together, we reach down, dig deep, find the strength we need to find, fight for what we believe in -- and celebrate each other along the way.

        "Body": "When we started this presidential campaign, I saw two options for how we could run it: 1. Focus on building a grassroots movement entirely with grassroots donors and volunteers. 2. Or spend a lot time with wealthy people behind closed doors, and then hope we have enough money to buy a bunch of TV ads right before voting starts. For me, the choice was clear. I picked option #1. Here's what that looks like: I'm not doing any high-dollar private fundraisers with millionaires and corporate executives. I don't take any corporate PAC money, or PAC money of any kind. I don't take any Washington lobbyist money. And I'm not out sucking up to a bunch of billionaires hoping that they're going to run a Super PAC for me. In other words, we're running this movement with grassroots donors and grassroots volunteers. That makes your support even more powerfully important. If you think this is the best way to run a campaign, we need you to be in this fight -- can you chip in right now? ++HYPERLINK++ We have a real opportunity right now in a Democratic primary to build a campaign from the grassroots up. And you know what? If we seize that opportunity, our grassroots movement will be our big advantage when we roll into the general election in 2020. That means we'll get a better chance at winning the White House. We'll be more ready to win up and down the ballot -- to keep the House, get control of the Senate, and take back more state houses. When you build from the grassroots, it helps everybody who's in the fight, not just in the presidential race. Our grassroots movement will bring the energy we need to make big, structural change -- the change we need so that someone like the guy in the White House never gets elected president again. It's the right way to run, and the best way to win. But person-to-person, face-to-face organizing takes real resources. So what do you say? Can you pitch in $3 or whatever you can afford so we can keep growing our movement? Side by side, you and me -- this is how we'll win. ++HYPERLINK++ Thanks for being a part of this, Elizabeth DONATE: ++HYPERLINK++ Paid for by Warren for President ____________________________________________ All content 2019 Warren for President, All Rights Reserved PO Box 171375, Boston, MA 02116 ____________________________________________ This email was sent to TestBro1745@gmail.com.

But it's the only way to follow through on what I talked about in last night's debate: Making Washington work for everyone, not just the rich and powerful. I'm not holding any fundraisers where you can only get in by writing a big check -- because a person's wealth shouldn't determine the amount of time they can spend with me, or with any presidential candidate. I'm not counting on a billionaire to fund a Super PAC for me -- because the Democratic primary can't just be one more plaything for the rich and powerful. I'm not taking a dime from federally registered lobbyists, corporate PACs, or PACs of any kind -- because our campaign is about people, not powerful special interests. Instead, we're building a true grassroots campaign with grassroots donors -- because that's the only way we'll create a movement strong enough to make big, structural change in our economy, our government, and our democracy. I wouldn't ask if it weren't powerfully important: Before Sunday's FEC deadline, will you make your first donation to our campaign? $3 or whatever you can chip in would make a huge difference. I can't do this without you. ++HYPERLINK++ On a typical presidential campaign, this close to an FEC deadline, my team would be flying me from big city to big city to scoop up as many big fat checks as possible. Wealthy donors might come see me at fancy receptions in hedge fund offices. They'd sip champagne, nibble on shrimp cocktail, and try to convince me that the tax loophole that just so happens to pad their pockets is also good for the whole country. But I'm not running to be a president who only pays attention to the wealthy and well-connected. I'm running to be everybody's president. My time is not for sale, and every supporter has an equal place in our movement. Instead of getting cozy with the rich and powerful, I'll keep traveling across the country to host meet-and-greets and organizing events. Anyone's welcome to come -- no big check required. If you ask me, that's what a campaign for president should be all about. Talking with people, in their hometowns, about real solutions to real problems. Getting organized at the grassroots level to make change happen. But this type of campaign is only possible if everyone who is able pitches in what they can. I'm running to be the best president that money can't buy, but I can't do it alone. This is how we'll stop Washington from just answering to the beck and call of billionaires and giant corporations -- one grassroots donation at a time.

        "Body": "There's a question that comes up whenever we talk about big, structural change: How are you going to pay for it? Well, I've got a plan, and here's a part of it: the Ultra-Millionaire Tax. It's just two cents on every dollar of the great fortunes above $50 million. Just two cents! And an extra cent on fortunes over $1 billion. And it's about asking the people with those great fortunes to spend just a minute to remember how they got it. They built that great business, or their families did, using workers that all of us helped pay to educate. They got their goods to market using roads and bridges that all of us helped pay to build. They were protected in their factories with firefighters and police officers that all of us helped to pay. Good for them. But now that they've got that great fortune, they've got to pay something back so everybody else gets a chance. And here's how the money works out: If we put the Ultra-Millionaire Tax in place for the 75,000 largest fortunes in the country, we can do Universal Child Care, do universal pre-k, do universal free public college, and cancel student loan debt for 42 million Americans. All that -- and we'd still have nearly a trillion dollars left over. I'll keep fighting to make sure the rich and powerful pay their fair share so we can make the investments we've got to make as a country. But I can't do it alone. I'm deeply grateful that you're on this team.

        "From": "Elizabeth Warren <info@elizabethwarren.com>",
        "Body": "Today, I'm calling for something truly transformational. I have a new plan to cancel up to $50,000 in student loan debt for 42 million Americans and make universal free college a reality for all. It's fully paid for (and then some) by my Ultra-Millionaire Tax on the richest 0.1%. We can make this big, structural change -- as long as we build a grassroots movement to fight for it. Add your name to say you support canceling student loan debt and making college free. ++HYPERLINK++ According to independent experts, 95% of people who have student loan debt right now would get at least some of it canceled under my plan. And more than 75% would get all of it cancelled -- poof, gone. We'd provide targeted cancellation for the families that need it most, substantially increasing Black and Latinx wealth, and helping decrease the racial wealth gap. Once we've cleared out the debt that's holding down an entire generation of Americans, we'll ensure that we never have another student debt crisis again. We can do that by recognizing that a public college education is like a public K-12 education -- a basic public good that should be available to everyone for free. My plan for universal free college would give every American the opportunity to attend a two-year or four-year public college without paying a dime in tuition or fees. And we'll make free college truly universal -- not just in theory, but in practice -- by making higher education of all kinds more inclusive and available to every single American, especially lower-income, Black, and Latinx students, without the need to take on debt to cover costs. Free tuition, and zero debt at graduation. This fight is personal for me. Growing up, my dream was to become a teacher. And I knew that if I wanted to teach, I had to get a college degree. I managed to get a college scholarship, but then things turned upside down. The first boy I ever dated swooped back into my life and said he wanted to marry me. So I did what any sensible, mature 19-year-old would do: I said yes and dropped out of college. I thought my dream of teaching was over. But then a friend told me about the University of Houston, a public four-year college about 40 minutes away. We were a young couple, watching every nickel. I figured I couldn't afford it. But it turned out that tuition was just $50 a semester. This was a quality, public education -- and I could afford it on a part-time waitressing salary. This time, I had the good sense to grab my chance at college with both hands. I got my degree and I got to live my dream: I became a teacher for students with special needs. Higher education opened a million doors for me, and I want every American to have the same opportunity. It's how the daughter of a janitor in Oklahoma got to become a teacher, a law school professor, a U.S. senator, and eventually, a candidate for president of the United States. Together, we can get this done. We can relieve the student loan debt burden that 42 million Americans carry on their shoulders every day -- and we can address the root cause of this crisis by making universal free college a reality.

But Elizabeth decided to do things differently: She's not giving anyone special access based on how much they can contribute to her campaign. Her time is not for sale, and every supporter has an equal place in our movement. That means she gets to spend her time the way she wants: Talking with people across the country about real solutions to real problems -- which is exactly what she'll be doing in Indiana tonight. And then getting organized at the grassroots level to make change happen. We know swearing off private swanky fundraisers leaves money on the table.

Here's the way I see it: Our campaign is based on big ideas and a core principle -- everyone gets equal access because we're fighting for a government that works for everyone. Our democracy is not for sale, and neither is my time. So I'm opting out of the unwritten rule of politics that says I'm supposed to run for office by sucking up to rich donors on Wall Street and powerful interests in Washington. I'm not hosting swanky fundraisers where you can only get in if you write a ginormous check. I'm not taking PAC money, donations from federal lobbyists, or applications from billionaires who want to run a Super PAC on my behalf. If we keep letting big money control our campaigns, we'll keep seeing Washington only work for people who can afford to hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers. We're fighting to change all that. We're building a grassroots movement to put power in the hands of the people, not the wealthy and well-connected. And it's only possible with contributions from people like you.

I've got a plan -- a bunch of plans -- to level the playing field for working people and make sure we're building a future not just for some of our kids, but all of our kids. If the rich and powerful don't like it, then tough. We've got to make big, structural change -- we're going to -- but it'll take a massive grassroots movement to get it done. We're ready to dream big and fight hard. I see it in people's faces all across the country, including in South Carolina, Texas, Iowa, and Nevada in the past week.

We'll add you to a list of some of our best supporters to make sure whenever Elizabeth and the campaign release a new proposal, you'll be one of the first to know all about it!

        "Date": "Thu, 11 Jul 2019 21:23:26 +0000",
        "From": "Elizabeth Warren <info@elizabethwarren.com>",
        "Body": "Today, I'm announcing my plan for immigration reform. Immigrants are our neighbors, our friends, our family -- they make our country stronger and more diverse. But our immigration system is broken, and we need real reform. We can create a rules-based system that is fair, humane, and that reflects our values, from expanding legal immigration and creating a fair and achievable path to citizenship to ending the hatred, ugliness, and chaos at the border. If you want an immigration system that preserves our security, grows our economy, and reflects our values, then be a part of the grassroots movement that will make it happen. Add your name if you're with me. ++HYPERLINK++ When I say that our immigration system needs to reflect our values, here's what I plan to do: 1. Eliminate abusive enforcement and significantly reduce immigrant detention. Entering the country without authorization has always been a violation of civil immigration law, but thanks to a former segregationist Senator, it's also a criminal violation. This criminal prohibition is totally unnecessary for border security, and we should repeal it. As president, I will immediately end criminal prosecutions for simple administrative immigration violations and refocus our limited resources on actual criminals and real threats to the United States. I will also reshape CBP and ICE from top to bottom. Our immigration agencies should protect Americans and uphold the rule of law, not pursue punitive policies that target communities of color. I'll hold immigration enforcement to the same due process standards as other law enforcement agencies and strengthen watchdogs to prevent future abuses. Under a Warren administration, if anyone's violated the basic rights of immigrants, we'll hold them accountable. That includes the abuses committed under the Trump administration. I'll set up a DOJ task force to investigate accusations of serious violations -- including medical neglect and physical and sexual assaults -- and give it independent authority to pursue any criminal allegations. And I'll end unnecessary detention and eliminate private detention facilities. We already have the tools to effectively track and monitor individuals without shoving them into cages and camps. As president, I'll issue guidance ensuring detention is only used when an individual poses a flight or safety risk. 2. Provide rights and due process in our immigration courts. To prevent future abuses, a Warren administration will establish professional, independent immigration courts and recruit highly qualified immigration judges with a diverse set of legal experiences so that everyone receives appropriate justice. Right now, most immigrants facing deportation do not have attorneys -- and in the Trump administration, that even includes toddlers. I'll eliminate the use of expedited removal proceedings, guarantee hearings, and provide access to counsel in immigration court. 3. Welcome those in need. Our laws and our values compel us to help those fleeing violence and oppression. My administration will raise the refugee cap and reject exclusionary policies based on race, religion, and nationality. On my first day in office, I'll reverse Trump's bigoted Muslim Ban. As president, I will also reverse Trump's efforts to stack the deck against asylum applicants. I'll ensure that asylum seekers can safely present themselves, restore President Obama's promise to extend asylum for those fleeing domestic or gang violence, and affirm asylum protections for gender identity and sexual orientation-based claims. 4. Grow legal immigration and establish a fair and achievable path to status. I'll work to expand legal immigration to grow our economy and reunify families. We should also make it easier for those eligible to naturalize, and repeal the 3- and 10-year bars preventing people from applying for legal status. I'll take executive action to restore and expand protections for our Dreamers. And I'll extend deferred action protections to those who have contributed to our country for years and have built careers and families here, while also pursuing a legislative solution that provides a fair and achievable path to citizenship. 5. Address the root causes of migration. We cannot fully address migration until we address its root causes -- poverty, climate change, violence, and injustice. The solution to Central American migration isn't placing children in cages -- it's stabilizing the countries that families are risking their lives to escape. As president, I'll restore and increase aid, step up efforts to address transnational crime, and protect those seeking refuge here. Donald Trump wants to divide us -- to pit worker against worker, neighbor against neighbor. He wants Americans to blame their troubles on those who are new to our country, or who don't look the same, even as his administration robs us dry. But we know that immigrants helped weave the very fabric of our country in the past -- and we know that immigrants belong here today. We need big, structural change to fix our immigration system. And we need a grassroots movement to make it happen. Add your name today, and let's fix this broken system together. ++HYPERLINK++ Thanks for being a part of this, Elizabeth ADD YOUR NAME: ++HYPERLINK++ Elizabeth doesn't accept contributions from PACs of any kind or federally registered lobbyists.

I'm not holding any fundraisers where you can only get in by writing a big check -- because a person's wealth shouldn't determine how much time they can spend with me, or with any presidential candidate. I'm not asking a billionaire to bankroll a Super PAC for me -- because the Democratic primary can't just be one more plaything for the rich and powerful. I'm not taking a dime from Washington lobbyists, corporate PACs, or, shoot, PACs of any kind -- because our campaign is about people, not powerful special interests. Instead, we're running a fully grassroots-funded campaign with grassroots donors -- because that's the only way we'll build a movement strong enough to make big, structural change in our economy, our government, and our democracy. And right now, I'll just be blunt: We need to catch up a bit on our July fundraising. Tomorrow night, I'll find out which night I'll be in our next Democratic presidential debate. By then, I'd love to be able to know that we're back on track to hit this month's goal.

The total numbers will get a lot of attention, and they should. They matter. But it's also powerfully important that we show where we get our money in this fight.

Will you chip in at this critical moment to make sure we have the strength we need to keep growing our movement? ++HYPERLINK++ In a country where people who can write fat checks call the shots, I was very glad that our first quarterly fundraising report showed that we could do things differently. You are the backbone of our movement, and it's built with small dollar contributions. We have to make it clear before the next big deadline on Sunday: We can run a presidential campaign where a lot of people chip in a little bit at a time to create something incredible. We can get big money out of politics, root corruption out of Washington, and make Washington work for everyone -- not just the people who can afford to hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers, or who can write a giant check to chat up a candidate at a private fundraiser. That is the power of a grassroots-funded campaign, and that is my promise to you: I'll never stop fighting to make sure everyone gets a fighting chance.

        "Body": "First of all, thank you so much for being on this team. We're so grateful that you're part of the grassroots movement keeping up the fight in your state and all across the country. As you might remember, we had a big FEC fundraising deadline at the end of June and we wanted to report back our totals to the whole team. Here's what you made possible: - We raised over $19.1 million in the last three months - That came from more than 384,000 people making more than 683,000 donations in the last 3 months alone - More than 80% of those donors gave for the first time in Q2 - Our average contribution was just $28 To sum it up: We raised more money than any other 100% grassroots-funded campaign. That's big. You sent a message that Elizabeth's vision for the future is worth fighting for. And you showed the rich and powerful that change is coming -- sooner than they think. You're making it possible to build a presidential campaign without catering to wealthy donors -- with no closed-door fundraisers, no Super PACs, and no money from Washington lobbyists, corporate PACs, or, for that matter, PACs of any kind. A lot of eyes are on this campaign right now. We need to seize every opportunity we can to reach as many people as possible -- and make every possible investment in grassroots organizing, person-to-person and vote by vote. That's what will lead us to victory in the Democratic primary and in 2020. In the weeks and months ahead, we'll keep growing our movement across the country and Elizabeth will keep rolling out new plans to level the playing field for working people. Now's the time to keep up the pace. Will you take the next step and become a grassroots donor and help fund this movement for big, structural change? We can only win when we have everyone working together. Even $3 makes a powerful difference in our ability to organize in communities across the country. ++HYPERLINK++ Thanks again for everything.

        "Body": "When we started this presidential campaign, I saw two options for how we could run it: 1. Focus on building a grassroots movement entirely with grassroots donors and volunteers. 2. Or spend a lot time with wealthy people behind closed doors, and then hope we have enough money to buy a bunch of TV ads right before voting starts. For me, the choice was clear. I picked option #1. Here's what that looks like: I'm not doing any high-dollar private fundraisers with millionaires and corporate executives. I don't take any corporate PAC money, or PAC money of any kind. I don't take any Washington lobbyist money. And I'm not out sucking up to a bunch of billionaires hoping that they're going to run a Super PAC for me. In other words, we're running this movement with grassroots donors and grassroots volunteers. That makes your support even more powerfully important. If you think this is the best way to run a campaign, we need you to be in this fight -- can you chip in right now? ++HYPERLINK++ We have a real opportunity right now in a Democratic primary to build a campaign from the grassroots up. And you know what? If we seize that opportunity, our grassroots movement will be our big advantage when we roll into the general election in 2020. That means we'll get a better chance at winning the White House. We'll be more ready to win up and down the ballot -- to keep the House, get control of the Senate, and take back more state houses. When you build from the grassroots, it helps everybody who's in the fight, not just in the presidential race. Our grassroots movement will bring the energy we need to make big, structural change -- the change we need so that someone like the guy in the White House never gets elected president again. It's the right way to run, and the best way to win. But person-to-person, face-to-face organizing takes real resources. So what do you say? Can you pitch in $3 or whatever you can afford so we can keep growing our movement? Side by side, you and me -- this is how we'll win. ++HYPERLINK++ Thanks for being a part of this, Elizabeth DONATE: ++HYPERLINK++ Paid for by Warren for President ____________________________________________ All content 2019 Warren for President, All Rights Reserved PO Box 171375, Boston, MA 02116 ____________________________________________ This email was sent to TestBro1745@gmail.com.

        "Body": "Bruce and I love to hike. We've been all over, from Bryce Canyon in Utah to Alaska to the Cape Cod National Seashore in our backyard. America's public lands are one of our greatest treasures. They provide us with clean air and water, sustain our fish and wildlife, and offer a place where millions of Americans go every year to experience the beauty of our natural environment. At 25% of America's total land, they are also an irreplaceable resource. But right now, they're under attack. The Trump administration is busy selling off our public lands to the oil, gas, and coal industries for pennies on the dollar -- expanding fossil fuel extraction that destroys pristine sites across the country while pouring an accelerant on our climate crisis. It doesn't have to be this way. That's why today I'm rolling out my plan to protect our public lands -- to fight climate change and preserve wild, natural places for future generations. With this new plan, we'll ban new fossil fuel drilling offshore and on our public lands, generate more renewable energy from them instead, establish free entry to all national parks, and more. Sign our petition and join the fight if you support more protection for public lands. ++HYPERLINK++ Here are a few big pieces of my plan: - On my first day as president, I'll sign an executive order that calls for a total moratorium on all fossil fuel drilling offshore and on public lands - Set a goal of getting at least 10 percent of America's overall electricity generation from renewables offshore and on public lands -- nearly ten times what we're currently generating - Keep our public lands in public hands, and restore protections to the national monuments targeted by this administration - Maintain and improve our public lands -- including a 21st Century Civilian Conservation Corps, creating jobs for thousands of young Americans caring for our natural resources - Provide free entry -- for everyone -- to all of our national parks There's no better illustration of how backwards our public lands strategy is than the fact that today, we hand over drilling rights to fossil fuel companies for practically no money at all -- and then turn around and charge families who make the minimum wage more than a day's pay to access our parks. It's long past time to ensure that visiting our nation's treasures is within reach for every American family. While we're getting all this done, we'll make sure that state, local, and tribal officials have a real role in managing our public lands, and that their voices are heard through meaningful consultation and coordination. America's public lands belong to all of us. We should start acting like it -- expanding access, ending fossil fuel extraction, leveraging them as part of the climate solution, and preserving and improving them for our children and grandchildren. Together, we can make sure we manage and protect our public lands for generations to come. But it's going to take all of us fighting against large fossil fuel companies to get it done.

Instead of getting cozy with the rich and powerful, I'm in New Hampshire this weekend for meet-and-greets and organizing events. Anyone's welcome to come -- no big check required. If you ask me, that's what a campaign for president should be all about. Talking with everyday Americans, in their hometowns, about real solutions to real problems. Getting organized at the grassroots level to make change happen. Having conversations with school-teachers, bus operators, McDonald's workers (hello, Logan in Idaho!), and anyone who gives a little at a time. But this type of campaign is only possible if everyone who is able pitches in what they can. I'm running to be the best president that money can't buy, but I can't do it alone. This is how we'll stop Washington from just answering to the beck and call of billionaires and giant corporations -- one grassroots donation at a time. Without the backing of wealthy donors, I truly need your help to make sure the ideas we care about continue to be part of the national conversation. Please make your first contribution to own a piece of this campaign. Let's build something incredible together. ++HYPERLINK++ Thanks for being a part of this, Elizabeth DONATE NOW: ++HYPERLINK++ Paid for by Warren for President ____________________________________________ All content 2019 Warren for President, All Rights Reserved PO Box 171375, Boston, MA 02116 ____________________________________________ This email was sent to TestBro1745@gmail.com.

        "Body": "The Mueller report lays out facts showing that a hostile foreign government attacked our 2016 election to help Donald Trump and Donald Trump welcomed that help. Once elected, Donald Trump obstructed the investigation into that attack. Mueller put the next step in the hands of Congress: \"Congress has authority to prohibit a President's corrupt use of his authority in order to protect the integrity of the administration of justice.\" The correct process for exercising that authority is impeachment. To ignore a president's repeated efforts to obstruct an investigation into his own disloyal behavior would inflict great and lasting damage on this country, and it would suggest that both the current and future presidents would be free to abuse their power in similar ways. The severity of this misconduct demands that elected officials in both parties set aside political considerations and do their constitutional duty. That means the House should initiate impeachment proceedings against the president of the United States.

        "From": "Elizabeth Warren <info@elizabethwarren.com>",
        "Body": "I've spent most of my career studying what's happening to working families in America. And when I saw the seeds of the 2008 crisis growing, I rang the alarm as loud as I could. Back then, people with the power to stop the crisis didn't listen. And when the crisis hit in 2008, working families lost it all while the big banks that broke the economy got a fat taxpayer bailout. When I look at the economy today, I see a lot to worry about again. The good news is that we have the chance to head off another crisis if we take bold action now to address the underlying problems in the economy. That's why I've got a new plan to tackle these threats before it's too late -- by reducing household debt, limiting dangerous corporate behavior, strengthening manufacturing, and limiting potential risks to the economy. Read on to learn more, and add your name if you're ready to fight for this plan. ++HYPERLINK++ Here are some of the warning signs I see flashing in our economy: A generation of stagnant wages and rising costs have forced American families to take on more debt than ever before. The student debt load has more than doubled since the financial crisis, and credit card debt is at another high. Families may be able to afford some of those debt payments now, but a slowdown in income could plunge families over a cliff. Corporations are also deeply in debt. Leveraged lending -- lending to companies that are already seriously in debt -- has jumped by 40% since Trump took office. These bets look a lot like the pre-2008 subprime mortgages: poorly-underwritten high-risk loans, with minimal protections. Just like last time, their risk-taking is dangerous for all of us. Despite Donald Trump's promises of a manufacturing \"renaissance,\" the country is now in a manufacturing recession. The manufacturing sector has just gone through a second straight quarter of decline, and for the first time ever, the average hourly wage for manufacturing workers has dropped below the national average. The country's economic foundation is fragile. A single shock could bring it all down. And the Trump administration's reckless behavior is increasing the odds. The administration may hit the debt ceiling in September, leading to economic turmoil that some have compared to the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Trump's trade war with China also threatens American manufacturing and has already hurt American companies that investors think of as bellwethers. But the good news is, we can still head off another crisis if we act now. Here's my plan to put our economy -- and our families -- on firmer ground: Reduce household debt. We need to reduce household debt by raising wages and by bringing down working families' costs. That is the heart of my economic agenda. We can raise incomes by increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour, strengthening unions, and ensuring that women of color get the wages they deserve. We can slash household debt by cancelling student loan debt, bringing down the cost of rent, providing universal affordable child care, and making tuition free at public colleges. Monitor and reduce leveraged corporate lending: In response to the 2008 crisis, Congress created the Financial Stability Oversight Council to monitor risks across that cut across different markets. But right now, Trump-era regulators are falling down on the job. They should focus on the risks posed by highly indebted companies and stop banks from issuing these risky loans in the first place. Strengthen manufacturing: We need policies that reverse the manufacturing job losses of the past twenty years. My Green Manufacturing Plan will mobilize our industrial base by making a $2 trillion investment in American green research, manufacturing, and exporting over the next decade. This will create more than a million high-quality jobs and help address the existential threat of climate change. Limit potential shocks to the economy: The Trump Administration should replace the trade-war-by-tweet with China with a coherent strategy -- working with our allies -- to respond to China's trade tactics. We need to invest in strengthening critical American industries, instead of undercutting American companies. Whether it's this year or next year, the odds of another economic downturn are high -- and growing. Congress and regulators should act immediately to tamp down these threats. Add your name and join this fight if you're ready for our government to finally learn the lessons of 2008 -- and stop another crisis before it's too late. ++HYPERLINK++ Thanks for being part of this, Elizabeth ADD YOUR NAME: ++HYPERLINK++ Elizabeth doesn't accept contributions from PACs of any kind or federally registered lobbyists.

She's hosted zero events for big-shots from Goldman Sachs, or Citibank, or J.P. Morgan. Here's what it all adds up to: Elizabeth hasn't spent any hours asking the rich and powerful how to make the economy work even better for them. Instead, she's focused on working families and their fight to make ends meet. She's talking about Universal Child Care and early education, and canceling student loan debt, and free public college -- and her Ultra-Millionaire Tax to pay for it all and more. Wall Street is watching this movement, and they don't like what they see. That's a great sign that we're on the right track. Elizabeth is serious about big, structural change, and we're ready to win this whole thing. But it's only possible if we all own a piece of this fight.

As a presidential candidate, he proposed bold and progressive policies -- including reforming our immigration laws, fixing our broken criminal justice system, improving access to child care, and protecting the rights and equality of people with disabilities. He's made the Democratic primary more substantive, and his vision was always clear: Lift up the voices of the people who are struggling the most, and fight for deep, systemic reform. I'm deeply grateful to receive his endorsement today. It is an honor to fight side by side with Julin Castro for the big, structural change we need. And I'd be honored if you'd join our fight, too.

And we both have succeeded because we got a shot at the American Dream. I grew up on the ragged edge of the middle class in Oklahoma. When I was 12 years old, my daddy had a heart attack and was out of work for a long time. We lost our family station wagon, and we were inches away from losing our home. One day, my mother pulled on her best dress, walked down the street and got her first paying job outside the home: answering the phones at Sears. That minimum wage job saved our home and it saved our family. My life had a lot of twists and turns along the way, but I went on to attend public college for $50 a semester, graduate from law school, and become a teacher, a professor, and a US Senator -- because America invested in me. Now, Julin and I are fighting side by side to ensure that families in our country today can have the same opportunity to achieve their dreams as ours did. I admired the campaign that Julin Castro ran, and I'll continue to fight for our vision of justice and opportunity -- where everyone gets the chance to succeed and thrive. I paid close attention to the big ideas he was adding to the race (I always appreciate when someone has a plan), and I was always glad to run into him on the trail, from debate stages to the Iowa Steak Fry. Tomorrow, we'll come together again and speak at an event in New York City. We'll talk about putting political and economic power in the hands of the people, where it belongs. And we'll continue to fight to make it happen -- but we can't do it alone. I hope to earn your support as well.

        "Body": "All three of my big brothers served in the military. I know the responsibilities we owe to our service members, veterans, and their families. So I've got a new plan to improve military housing, and I'd like to take a minute to tell you about it. The way it works right now, a handful of private developers have taken over 99% of domestic military family housing. Driven by short-term payoffs and with little meaningful oversight, these contractors have failed to maintain the homes they were entrusted with. Military families have been living with lead paint, faulty wiring, collapsing ceilings, and mice infestations. Mold has taken over entire rooms. Kids are getting sick from living in these homes. That's not how we should treat our service members -- and it needs to stop now. My plan would improve our military housing, protect families from abuse, and hold private developers accountable. Add your name if you're ready to be a part of this fight. ++HYPERLINK++ Here's how it'll work. Let's start with something simple: If a developer doesn't live up to the terms of its agreement to maintain habitable properties for our military families, we shouldn't reward them with bonuses or other incentive payments. In fact, I'll require the Secretary of Defense to standardize leases across the military services and review all existing housing contracts for violations before they can be renewed. Under my proposal, every base will have a housing office staffed with advocates for service members -- not beholden to private contractors. That office will have independent authority to inspect housing on base to ensure that it's safe, clean, and meets all state and local requirements. It'll be illegal for any senior defense official -- or any member of Congress who oversees them -- to benefit from investing in a military housing company with business before the Pentagon. Military tenants will get a \"bill of rights,\" in writing, when they move in to protect them from abuse. First on the list: Families can withhold payment when landlords don't play by the rules. Second: If a service member's home needs repairs or remediation, the work order can't be closed until the service member approves. And if the family has to stay somewhere else during repairs, the landlord pays for that, too -- and in a worst case scenario, a service member should be able to move off base without penalty. There'll be one standardized resident satisfaction survey across all the services -- conducted independently from the housing provider -- and one consolidated database of resident complaints. We'll make all those results public to make sure every military family can make an informed choice about where to live when they move. We also need to take care of families who've been harmed. The impacts of substandard housing can linger for a lifetime. My plan requires the Pentagon to establish a health registry for service members and their families, and to screen and track for medical conditions they got as a result of unsafe housing. And my plan would provide lifetime care for any dependent child who was harmed by substandard housing. The sacrifices our service members, veterans, and their families make -- constant moves, repeated deployments -- are enormous. The way I see it, this isn't complicated -- it's not even a close call: No matter where they are stationed, the very least we owe our military personnel is a safe, affordable place to live. If we can't provide that, it's bad for morale, it's bad for retention, it's bad for readiness -- but most importantly, it's a breach of trust owed to those who volunteer to defend our country. Add your name if you're with me, and let's fight to make sure our service members can count on decent housing. ++HYPERLINK++ Thanks for being a part of this, Elizabeth SIGN THE PETITION: ++HYPERLINK++ Elizabeth doesn't accept contributions from PACs of any kind or federally registered lobbyists.

        "From": "Elizabeth Warren <info@elizabethwarren.com>",
        "Body": "When there's something we need to do to take care of the people we love, no matter how hard it is, we reach down, pull it up, and do what we need to do. That's the story of people across the country -- going to work before the sun's up, taking extra classes, scrambling to find child care so they can gain a foothold to work for the American dream. But right now, because of decades of systemic discrimination, when women of color work to provide financial security for their families, they face a steeper climb. The gender wage gap hits women of color particularly hard. Employers trap women of color in lower wages by using salary history to make new offers. Black and Brown women are disproportionately mistreated at work. And their path to higher-level management jobs is rockier. It's time to get to work to right those wrongs. So today, I'm announcing my new plan to help boost wages for women of color and open up new pathways to the leadership positions they deserve. Add your name if you're with me in this fight. ++HYPERLINK++ On Day One of a Warren administration, we'll make this plan happen with a series of executive actions: 1. Historic new requirements for federal contractors. Companies with federal contracts employ roughly a quarter of the U.S. workforce. By imposing new rules on companies that hope to receive federal contracts, we can take a big step toward creating equal opportunities for Black, Latina, Native American, Asian and other women of color. Companies with bad track records on equal pay and management diversity won't get new contracts. No contractor will be permitted to use forced arbitration clauses, or non-compete clauses for low- and medium-wage workers. We'll ban contractors from asking applicants for past salary information and criminal histories, and ensure fair pay and benefits for all of their workers -- including a $15 minimum wage, paid family leave, fair scheduling, and collective bargaining rights. This will have an outsized effect on Black and Brown women, who perform a disproportionate share of lower-wage work. 2. Making sure the senior ranks of the federal government look like America. Right now, the federal government does a dismal job on diversity and inclusion. The share of Latinas in the federal workforce is about half that of the entire workforce. And even though Black women are disproportionately represented in the federal workforce, they are nearly absent from its leadership ranks. My administration will ensure that federal agencies recruit women of color and develop leadership paths for them. If we're going to demand more of the private sector, we should demand more of the government too. 3. Strengthening and targeting enforcement against systemic discrimination. Sectors that disproportionately employ Black and Brown women -- such as the low-wage service industry -- have higher rates of discriminatory practices. But women in these sectors are much less likely to report violations. I will direct federal agencies to target enforcement toward industries where we know women of color face higher rates of discrimination. This new plan is just the first step -- but it's a necessary one. It's time to build an America that recognizes the role that women of color play in their families and in the economy, that fairly values their work, and that delivers equal opportunity for everyone. Add your name if you agree, and let's work side by side to make sure everyone has an opportunity to fight for the American dream. ++HYPERLINK++ Thanks for being a part of this, Elizabeth ADD YOUR NAME: ++HYPERLINK++ Elizabeth doesn't accept contributions from PACs of any kind or federally registered lobbyists.

It's just one example of how Washington works hand-in-hand with private prison companies, who spend millions on lobbyists, campaign contributions, and revolving-door hires -- all to turn our criminal and immigration policies into ones that prioritize making them rich instead of keeping us safe. We need significant reform in both criminal justice and in immigration, to end mass incarceration and all of the unnecessary, cruel, and punitive forms of immigration detention that have taken root in the Trump Administration. The first step is to end this private profiteering off cruelty. That's why today, I'm proposing my plan to root out once and for all the profit incentives perverting our criminal and immigration systems. Add your name if you agree: We need to ban private prisons and detention centers and make sure companies aren't profiting off of exploiting people who are incarcerated. ++HYPERLINK++ Here's the plan: 1. Ban private prisons and detention facilities. There should be no place in America for profiting off putting more people behind bars or in detention. That's why I will shut down the use of federal private detention facilities by ending all contracts that the Bureau of Prisons, ICE, and the U.S. Marshals Service have with private detention providers. And I will extend these bans to states and localities by conditioning their receipt of federal public safety funding on their use of public facilities. 2. Stop contractors from charging service fees for essential services. Companies shouldn't be able to treat incarcerated individuals as captive profit centers. We should prohibit contractors from charging incarcerated and detained people for basic services they need, like phone calls, bank transfers, and healthcare. I'll also keep contractors from imposing exploitative price markups on other services they provide, like commissary or package services. And I'll prohibit companies from charging for re-entry, supervision, and probation services, too -- because no one should have to pay for their own incarceration, whether it's inside a facility or outside of one. 3. Hold contractors accountable by expanding oversight, transparency, and enforcement. We can keep contractors from cutting corners to make a quick buck by setting enforceable quality standards, regularly auditing and investigating contractors, and terminating their contracts if they fall short. We can prosecute companies that blatantly violate the law. And I'll make sure companies are held accountable no matter who's in the White House by allowing people to bring a lawsuit against abusive contractors who violate their rights. Here's what this all comes down to: The government has a basic responsibility to keep the people in its care safe -- not to use their punishment as an opportunity for profit. Right now, private prison companies make money from keeping people incarcerated and they spend some of that cash to lobby Washington to continue the cycle of mass incarceration. It's a vicious cycle, but as a grassroots movement, we can have the power to put a stop to it. Add your name if you agree. Let's fight to ban private prisons and detention centers, and let's stop profit-driven cruelty against incarcerated people. ++HYPERLINK++ Thanks for being a part of this, Elizabeth ADD YOUR NAME: ++HYPERLINK++ Paid for by Warren for President ____________________________________________ All content 2019 Warren for President, All Rights Reserved PO Box 171375, Boston, MA 02116 ____________________________________________ This email was sent to TestBro1745@gmail.com.

That's exactly what happened in Q2, and that's how we need to keep building this movement. We're so grateful that so many people have invested in this campaign for the first time.

We're hoping to show another big share of new donors this quarter, too -- can you chip in for the first time to own a piece of this campaign? ++HYPERLINK++ Pundits and reporters will be watching to see if we can keep these numbers up -- trying to judge whether grassroots fundraising works.

        "Body": "There are a lot of things we need to get done if Democrats win the White House, keep the House, and take back the Senate in 2020. Ending corruption in Washington. Universal Child Care. An Ultra-Millionaire Tax. Medicare for All. A Green New Deal. Solving our affordable housing crisis. The Senate will be key to any of that big, structural change. I've only served one term in the Senate -- but I've seen what's happening when it comes to filibusters. We all saw what Senate Republicans did to President Obama. I've watched Republicans abuse the rules when they're out of power, then turn around and blow off the rules when they're in power. We just saw it happen again this week. Republicans spent years -- years -- exploiting the rules to slow down or block President Obama's mainstream judges and Executive nominees. But now that they're in power, they're unilaterally changing those rules to speed up and ram through President Trump's extreme nominees. So let me be as clear as I can. When Democrats next have power, we should be bold and clear: we're done with two sets of rules--one for the Republicans and one for the Democrats. That means when Democrats have the White House again, if Mitch McConnell tries to do what he did to President Obama, and puts small-minded partisanship ahead of solving the massive problems facing this country, then we should get rid of the filibuster. Add your name if you agree, and be a part of this fight to make sure our government can actually represent the will of the people. And if that means getting rid of the filibuster, then goodbye, filibuster. ++HYPERLINK++ I'm not running for president just to talk about making real, structural change. I'm serious about getting it done. And part of getting it done means waking up to the reality of the United States Senate -- including the long, ugly history of the filibuster. It was only last year that the Senate finally passed a bill that would make lynching a federal crime. Last year. In 2018. Do you know when the first bill to make lynching a federal crime was introduced? In 1918. One hundred years ago. And it nearly became the law back then. It passed the House in 1922. But it got killed in the Senate -- by a filibuster. And then it got killed again. And again. And again. More than 200 times. An entire century of obstruction because a small group of racists stopped the entire nation from doing what was right. For generations, the filibuster was used as a tool to block progress on racial justice. And in recent years, it's been used by the far right as a tool to block progress on everything. We can't sit around for 100 years while the rich and powerful get richer and more powerful and everyone else falls further and further behind. We can't sit around for 100 years while climate change destroys our planet, while corruption pervades every nook and cranny of Washington, and while too much of a child's fate in life still rests on the color of their skin. The filibuster isn't sacred. It isn't chiseled on any stone tablets. Check the Constitution -- you won't see the word \"filibuster\" in there at all. Not even once. The Senate created the filibuster, and if necessary, the Senate can get rid of the filibuster. If we campaign and win on big ideas, but can't pass any of them in 2021 -- even with majorities in Congress -- the American people will think our government is just as rigged for the wealthy and well-connected as before. Because it will be. Enough with that. When we win this election, we will make the changes we need in this country.

        "Body": "My life's work has been around one central question: What's happening to hardworking people in America? What's happening to hollow out America's middle class? Why has the road to economic security gotten so rocky and steep -- and even rockier and steeper for people of color? Well, here's the answer: It wasn't an accident. It was because a series of decisions led to a change of who Washington actually works for. We have a government that works fabulously for giant drug companies. It just doesn't work for people trying to fill a prescription. We have a government that works terrifically for giant financial institutions. Just not for families trying to make it payday to payday and not get ripped off. We have a government that works great for giant oil companies that want to drill everywhere. Just not for the rest of us who see climate change bearing down upon us. When you see a government that only works great for those with money and power -- for those who can hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers -- that's corruption, plain and simple, and we need to call it out. So we're fighting for a government and an economy that works for everyone. But none of us can get this done alone. It takes a grassroots movement where we fight side by side. I don't sell my time to wealthy donors at private events, and I don't take any money from PACs or federal lobbyists. I'm deeply grateful that you're a part of this team -- can you make your first contribution today to help keep up the fight? ++HYPERLINK++ No matter what issue pulls you into this fight, a government that works great for the rich and powerful is at the core of every problem we've got. Student loans, health care, prescription drugs, a Green New Deal -- every decision made in Washington goes through the intersection of influence and money. And until we change that, we'll have a government that works better and better for a thinner and thinner slice at the top and leaves everyone else behind. So here's how I see this: We need to make change as a country. Not a nibble here, a piece over there. Big, systemic change. The kind of change that will make this government reflect the people again. And that starts with ending the unwritten rule that presidential candidates have to spend their time begging the wealthy and well-connected for campaign contributions. I'm ready to build this with you. Are you in? Can you donate $3 or whatever you can spare to help build our grassroots movement for real, structural change?

        "Body": "There are about a zillion ways we've got to expand opportunity for people across this country. But right now, I'd like to focus on just one part -- and that's Universal Child Care. Last month in Memphis, I met Latonya, a young mother who told me what it had been like when she was working and going to college. She struggled with child care over and over. She recalled the years in which she was often forced to choose between letting her young son babysit his even younger siblings or staying home from class and giving up her dream to build a future. Like millions of Black women in America, Latonya faced the tough odds, made do with what she had and came out on top. Today she has an associate's degree, a bachelor's degree, and a master's degree. But here's the kicker. Even with all of her diplomas, all of the progress she has made, child care is still holding her back. Her youngest is five years old, and he loves his school, but it costs $400 a month. Latonya said she can't afford it, and the cost still holds her back from taking on a better job. How many women have this same story? How many parents are sidelined today because they can't get decent care for their kids? And how many kids got a worse start in school because their moms couldn't afford pre-pre-K or couldn't send them to the places with small classes and specialized teachers? How many of our kids didn't make it because America wouldn't invest in them? We're the richest country in the history of the planet. Access to high-quality child care and education during the early stages of a child's life shouldn't be a privilege reserved for the children of the rich. It should be a right for every single child in America. That's why I've proposed a new Universal Child Care and Early Learning plan. But we don't get what we don't fight for, and it's going to take a grassroots movement to get it done. We can only keep campaigning and fighting for substantive ideas like these because of grassroots donors. Will you pitch in $3 and help fight for big, structural changes like Universal Child Care? ++HYPERLINK++ This fight is personal for me. When I was a young mom struggling to juggle two kids and a new job, child care almost knocked me out of the game. And high-quality child care is still out of reach for way too many families in this country. But it's even further out of reach for African American families. On average, child care for one kid costs the median African American household 22% of their income. Twenty-two percent. Try building a budget around that. The numbers tell the story: Black women are more likely to be breadwinners for their families, work more, get paid less, and are the least likely to afford decent child care. This isn't just an accident of statistics. It's the legacy of decades of systemic discrimination against black women -- in pay, housing, finance, health care, you name it. Pile all that together, then make high-quality child care expensive and hard to find, and it's little wonder that child care -- or the lack of good child care -- holds back one generation after another in communities of color. Our plan starts to address and fix that inequality. And I want you to know my plan is not only possible, but it is free for millions of children and low cost for families with higher incomes. That would be life-changing for millions of mothers -- and fathers -- around the country. And we already know how to pay for it! All we have to do is make the ultra-wealthy pay their fair share. I call it the Ultra-Millionaire Tax. That one change -- asking those at the top to pay their fair share -- would bring in all the money we would need to completely cover the cost of this Universal Child Care and Early Learning plan -- and have $2 trillion left over. These are the kinds of big structural changes I would make as president -- to make opportunity in America available for everyone. But I can't do it alone -- we're in this together. Side by side, we'll build a future not just for some of our kids, but all of our kids. If you're in this fight all the way, chip in what you can right now. ++HYPERLINK++ Thanks for being a part of this, Elizabeth DONATE NOW: ++HYPERLINK++ Paid for by Warren for President ____________________________________________ All content 2019 Warren for President, All Rights Reserved PO Box 171375, Boston, MA 02116 ____________________________________________ This email was sent to TestBro1745@gmail.com.

        "Body": "Never in a million years did I think I would stand on a presidential debate stage. I was born and raised in Oklahoma. My three older brothers all joined the military, and I had a dream growing up -- to be a public school teacher. But by the time I graduated from high school, my family didn't have money for a college application, let alone for tuition. I got my chance at a $50-a-semester commuter college. That was a little slice of government that created some opportunity for a girl. And it opened my life. I am in this fight because we can make our government, our economy, and our country work not just for those at the top -- we can make it work for everyone. And I promise you this: I will fight for you as hard as I fight for my own family. Here's the next step in our plan for big, structural change: We need as many people to own a piece of this fight as possible. The more grassroots donors who step up, the stronger our team is.

My oldest brother was career military and was deployed to Vietnam over a five year period. I grew up with my mother always watching for the mail. When a letter came from one of the boys, the day was extra-sunny. She would read it and re-read it, and call my Aunt Max or my grandmother to read it again over the phone. My brothers all made it home safely, and for that, I'm eternally grateful. It gave Memorial Day a special meaning: Understanding what others have lost, and honoring even more the sacrifice of those who died in service to our country and those who love them. We owe them a debt that can never be repaid. We're grateful. And here's part of how we show it: Doing everything we can to make sure the decisions made in Washington are in the best interest of our service members, their families, and our national security. Taking care of our veterans when they come home. And fighting to bring these forever wars to a close. No matter how you honor Memorial Day, I hope you have a meaningful day.

        "Body": "I want to talk about what happened yesterday in Alabama. And this morning in Missouri. And last week in Georgia. And in Arkansas and Mississippi in March. And in North Dakota and Ohio in April. Right now, a woman's constitutional right to abortion is under attack. States across the country are passing tighter and tighter restrictions making it harder, if not impossible, to access safe abortion or trying to ban it outright. In fact, most of these restrictions come into place before a woman would even know she's pregnant. It's important to say why this is happening right now: Republicans are on the march to overturn Roe v. Wade. And thanks to Donald Trump stacking the courts with anti-choice judges, that could be a real possibility. Access to safe, legal abortion is a constitutional right -- and we're going to fight this with everything we've got. I'll have more details on how to fight back soon, but if you'd like to take action today, here are some options: 1. ORGANIZE: If you are ready to organize and take action in your community, you can stay up-to-date on the latest news here: ++HYPERLINK++ 2.

        "From": "Elizabeth Warren <info@elizabethwarren.com>",
        "Body": "It's almost Tax Day, and chances are you'll be paying federal taxes this year. Maybe it's a lot, maybe it's a little. But chances are you'll be kicking in something for our military, for medical research, for highways and bridges -- the kinds of investments our federal government makes to defend our country and strengthen our economy. Well, guess what? You will be paying more for running the federal government than a bunch of big American corporations that made billions of dollars in profits last year. Take Amazon: $10 billion in profits, zero in federal corporate income taxes. Or Occidental Petroleum: $4.1 billion in profits, zero in federal corporate income taxes. In fact, year after year, some of the biggest corporations in the country make huge profits but pay zero federal corporate income taxes on those profits. This isn't right, and we need structural change to fix it. That's why I'm proposing a big new idea: the Real Corporate Profits Tax. It will make our biggest and most profitable corporations pay their fair share and ensure that none of them can ever make billions and pay zero taxes again. Sign our petition if you support our new plan, and let's make it happen. ++HYPERLINK++ This tax only applies to companies that report more than $100 million in profits -- about the 1,200 most profitable firms in the country last year. That first $100 million is left alone, but for every dollar of profit above $100 million, the corporation will pay a 7% tax. That means Amazon would pay $698 million in taxes on its profits instead of zero. Occidental Petroleum would pay $280 million instead of zero. And according to independent experts, this new tax will generate about $1 trillion over the next ten years. Now, you might be wondering -- aren't profitable companies already supposed to pay a corporate tax? Not exactly. There are two sets of rules for reporting a company's profits: one for reporting real profits to shareholders and the public, and another for reporting \"profits\" to the IRS. Corporations want to report as low of a profit figure as possible to the IRS. That's why they've lobbied hard to fill that second set of rules with as many loopholes, exemptions, and deductions as possible -- chipping away at their potential income tax bill until it doesn't exist at all. But they want to report as high of a profit figure as possible to investors to drive up stock prices: These are the profits we see in the news and on TV. So we'll apply the new Real Corporate Profits Tax to the real profits that they report to their investors, with no loopholes, no exceptions, and nothing to manipulate. This tax would also help level the playing field for small businesses -- by helping to neutralize the advantages that the largest companies give themselves by hiring armies of lobbyists, lawyers, and accountants to exploit every loophole we already have. Companies will be hesitant to under-report their profits to investors and the public -- which means they won't be able to game the tax system as much as they can now. American companies are among the most successful in the world. That success comes from our drive, our ingenuity, and our creativity. It also comes from a broad American infrastructure -- roads and bridges, public safety, telecommunications, education, our legal system -- that relies on government investment. Too many of our wealthiest companies have lost sight of this, and instead seek to cash in on all the benefits of America while skipping out on the bill. It's not right -- and we can't (and don't have to!) let it continue. You probably pay more in federal income taxes than some of America's biggest, most profitable corporations. Let's make this year the last year any company with massive profits pays zero federal taxes. Add your name if you're on board, and we'll fight side by side to pass the Real Corporate Profits Tax: ++HYPERLINK++ Thanks for being a part of this, Elizabeth SIGN THE PETITION: ++HYPERLINK++ Elizabeth doesn't accept contributions from PACs of any kind or federally registered lobbyists.

We want to make sure we have an accurate report of all our week one supporters. So if you support Joe Biden, please sign your name below: I'M ON TEAM JOE >> ++HYPERLINK++ Joe is running to rebuild the backbone of the country, and unify America. That means strengthening our middle class. This country wasn't built by bankers, CEOs or hedge fund managers, it was built by the American middle class. That's the story of America -- of ordinary people doing extraordinary things. Across the country, too many families are being left out. There used to be a basic bargain in this country that when you work hard, you were able to share in the prosperity your work helped create. Joe wants to restore that basic bargain for American workers. But recipientFirstName, he can't do it without you!

In the two years since I left the White House, we've seen this Administration praise neo-Nazis and white supremacists and rip families apart at the border. This isn't who we are. I want to get this country back on track, but I can't do it without your support. Our campaign's first end of month deadline is only 24 hours away and my team tells me we need to raise $425,677 more to hit our goal. recipientFirstName, that's why I'm reaching out to you personally. Can you chip in $5 or whatever you can afford? ++HYPERLINK++ Folks, I can honestly say that I am more optimistic today than when I got elected to the United States Senate as a 29-year old kid. There is no reason we can't own the 21st century. We just have to get out of our own way and remember who we are. We're Americans: tough, resilient, but always full of hope. It's time to treat each other with dignity. Build a middle class that works for everybody. Fight back against the incredible abuses of power we're seeing. It's time to dig deep and remember that our best days still lie ahead. recipientFirstName, together, we will restore this version of America. I promise you that. But the strength of this movement depends on you. Can you stand with me and chip in $5? ++HYPERLINK++ I hope you will join me on this journey.

I'm Greg Schultz, and I'm Joe Biden's campaign manager. This has been an exciting week! The response to our campaign has been amazing. I wanted to thank you for being on the team and making this campaign possible. Together, we raised the highest Day One total of any candidate in the field. We showed that there is grassroots excitement for Joe Biden and a place for him in this race to offer ideas, policies, and a plan to restore the soul of America. Here's the good news: Voters know Joe Biden. They know he will fight for the middle-class and working folks. They know he has taken on the NRA -- twice -- and won. They know he will bring climate change to the forefront of the conversation. And they know that he is a leader that is respected on the world stage. But here's what we're up against: There are a lot of candidates in the field, and with a crowded field we need to be on the ground and online talking directly to voters about the issues they care about. And to do that, we need to raise $1,200,000 more before our April 30 fundraising deadline, which is why I am writing to you today. Will you chip in to invest in our plan to build a strong grassroots operation in states across the country? Click the buttons below to make a donation: www.JoeBiden.com/Donate Joe is not taking anything for granted in this election. The donations we receive in April will go towards hiring staff in early states and making sure that we can catch up with programs that have been building for months. He wants to build a program that wins by talking to every last voter and having as many personal conversations as he can. We're not relying on his name alone. So recipientFirstName, in order to build this kind of program we need all of our supporters from the very beginning. Will you chip in today to help fund a winning strategy across the country? www.JoeBiden.com/Donate Thanks for reading. More to come.
