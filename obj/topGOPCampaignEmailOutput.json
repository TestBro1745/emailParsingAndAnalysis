Since I declared a National Emergency at our Southern Border, 16 liberal states have already filed a lawsuit to block it, and now the Democrats in the House are calling to repeal the order. TOTAL DISGRACE! What was once a respectable political party is now the Democratic party of: wide-open borders, 90% taxes, full-term abortion, the Green New Disaster, anti-military policies, and doing anything they can to ensure America's failure. I can confidently say that hard-working American Patriots absolutely despise these liberal talking points, but the Hollywood Elites (see Sunday's pathetic Oscar Awards display) LOVE these policies and are maxing out BIG TIME to their liberal friends. That's why I'm personally reaching out to you, as one of my top supporters, to help us keep pace and CRUSH our CRITICAL End-Of-Month goal.

TO: ++HYPERLINK++ recipientEmail FROM: Brad Parscale RE: Donald Trump's Path to 270 Electoral Votes in 2020 ________________________________________ Despite all the fake polls and so-called 'experts' telling us it was impossible, we CRUSHED Crooked Hillary Clinton by winning 306 electoral votes in 2016. We were able to flip SIX states that Barack Obama won in 2012 from blue to red while not letting Hillary win a single 2012 red state. Our winning strategy that helped flip Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Florida, and Iowa was simple: we outworked the other side. Democrats hadn't lost Wisconsin, Michigan, or Pennsylvania in nearly three decades, and Hillary was so confident in her 'blue wall' that she didn't even bother to campaign there. The latest 2020 polls show that we are in a VERY good position to win big again next November. Democrats' impeachment scam is DEEPLY unpopular among swing-state voters, and Nancy Pelosi seems quite content to lead her party off a cliff this year. We aren't taking a single state for granted. We have volunteers in all 50 states working tirelessly to ensure another Trump victory and helping to Keep America Great in 2020. Our priority right now is trying to widen the map and expand our path to victory in 2020. We will be VERY competitive in Minnesota, Nevada, Colorado, New Hampshire, Maine, New Mexico, and Virginia in addition to the 30 states we won in 2016. ++HYPERLINK++ In order to contend in these swing-states, we're going to need substantial financial resources to support our ads, rallies, and get-out-the-vote efforts. ________________________________________ Since you're one of my most trusted supporters, I want to give YOU the option to indicate which state you would prefer to see us invest your contribution in. ++HYPERLINK++ Contribute NOW and select which 2020 swing-state YOU think your contributions would help the most. >> ++HYPERLINK++ CONTRIBUTE $20 ++HYPERLINK++ CONTRIBUTE $15 ++HYPERLINK++ CONTRIBUTE $10 ++HYPERLINK++ CONTRIBUTE $5 ++HYPERLINK++ CONTRIBUTE ANY AMOUNT Thank you, ++HYPERLINK++ Donald J.

The media is hoping to claim that 2018 will be a referendum on President Trump. It's up to us to prove them WRONG. Let's show them that we are starting off the year stronger than we started his inauguration. America is waking up to the fake news. We're waking up to the lies liberals have been feeding our country for decades. We are still fighting to take our country, and we will not rest. ++HYPERLINK++ Please renew your 2018 Sustaining Membership for $35, and let's prove that President Trump has the FULL backing of the American people.
